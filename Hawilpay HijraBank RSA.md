Such access will be provided during normal business hours (unless otherwise agreed for urgent issues) and in compliance with Hijrabank’s applicable security and access policies.

**2.6** **Hijrabank's Infrastructure Responsibilities**: Hijrabank is responsible for procuring, installing, and maintaining the hardware, operating system software, database management system (RDBMS), network connectivity, and any third-party system software required for its systems to connect to and interact with the Hawilpay Platform. Hijrabank shall ensure that its hardware and system software are kept under appropriate maintenance and support agreements with their respective vendors to minimize downtime and facilitate troubleshooting. Hijrabank shall monitor and manage the performance, capacity, and availability of its infrastructure supporting the integration.

**2.7 Integration with CICO CASH Digital Wallet:**

(a) **Multi-Currency Wallet Platform**: The Parties acknowledge that Hijrabank has licensed a multi-currency digital wallet platform operating under the brand name "CICO CASH" (the "**CICO CASH Digital Wallet**" or "**Digital Wallet**"), which is provided and managed by CICO Financial Technologies pursuant to a separate Software Utilization Support & Maintenance License Agreement dated September 20, 2025 (the "**CICO SLA**"). The CICO CASH Digital Wallet is owned and operated by CICO Financial Technologies, a sister company to Hawilpay Inc.

(b) **Wallet-Based Payout Option**: In addition to traditional payout methods (cash pickup and bank account deposits), Remittance Transactions may be disbursed by crediting the Recipient's CICO CASH Digital Wallet account, subject to:
   
(i) The Recipient having an active and verified Digital Wallet account;
   
(ii) Successful technical integration between the Hawilpay Platform API and the CICO CASH Digital Wallet API;
   
(iii) The Recipient's selection of wallet credit as the preferred payout method (or Sender's selection on the Recipient's behalf).

(c) **Currency Options for Wallet Credits**: When a Remittance Transaction is paid out via Digital Wallet credit, the funds may be credited in either:
   
(i) **Ethiopian Birr (ETB)**: The USD remittance amount is converted to ETB at the foreign exchange rate determined by Hijrabank in accordance with Section 27 of this Agreement, and the Recipient's Digital Wallet is credited with the resulting ETB amount; or
   
(ii) **US Dollars (USD)**: The Digital Wallet is credited with the USD remittance amount without immediate currency conversion. The Recipient may subsequently convert USD to ETB within the Digital Wallet at foreign exchange rates determined by Hijrabank pursuant to its pricing authority under the CICO SLA.

(d) **Foreign Exchange Control and Revenue**: 
   
(i) Hijrabank retains full authority to set all foreign exchange rates applicable to Remittance Transactions, whether for immediate conversion (ETB wallet credit) or delayed conversion (USD wallet credit subsequently converted to ETB), consistent with Section 27 of this Agreement and Hijrabank's pricing authority under the CICO SLA.
   
(ii) All foreign exchange spread revenue (the difference between the official NBE rate and the rate offered to Recipients) shall accrue to Hijrabank and shall not be subject to revenue sharing with Hawilpay or CICO under this Agreement. Foreign exchange spread is distinct from transaction fees and is not included in any fee-sharing arrangements.
   
(iii) If Hijrabank charges a separate transaction fee or conversion fee (in addition to the FX spread) for wallet-based payouts or currency conversions within the Digital Wallet, any such fees shall be subject to revenue sharing with CICO Financial Technologies in accordance with the CICO SLA (50% CICO, 10% Operator Incentive, 40% Hijrabank), and shall not be shared with Hawilpay.

(e) **Technical Integration Responsibilities**:
   
(i) Hijrabank shall coordinate with CICO Financial Technologies to ensure that the Hawilpay Platform API can interface with the CICO CASH Digital Wallet API to enable automated wallet credits upon successful payout instructions;
   
(ii) Hijrabank shall be responsible for any integration development costs between the Hawilpay Platform and the Digital Wallet platform;
   
(iii) The technical integration shall support real-time payout confirmations and status updates to the Hawilpay Platform.

(f) **Settlement for Wallet-Based Payouts**: Settlement obligations under Section 3.6 shall apply equally to wallet-based payouts as to other payout methods. Hijrabank shall remit settlement funds to Hawilpay based on the USD value of the remittance, regardless of whether the Recipient's Digital Wallet was credited in USD or ETB.

(g) **Service Levels and Performance**: Wallet-based payouts shall be subject to the same service level commitments as other payout methods, including timely processing and real-time status updates. Any service disruptions related to the Digital Wallet platform shall be addressed pursuant to the CICO SLA, but shall not excuse Hijrabank's performance obligations to Hawilpay under this Agreement.

(h) **No Hawilpay Role in Wallet Operations**: Hawilpay shall have no role in, liability for, or control over the operation, management, or pricing of the CICO CASH Digital Wallet, which is owned and operated by CICO Financial Technologies (Hawilpay's sister company). Hijrabank, as the licensee of the CICO CASH Digital Wallet under the CICO SLA, is responsible for customer-facing aspects including customer service for wallet users, while CICO Financial Technologies retains ownership and operational control of the platform.

(i) **CICO Integration Benefits and Transaction Fee Framework**: The Parties acknowledge that wallet-based remittance payouts provide strategic benefits to the overall remittance ecosystem by:
   
(i) Enabling instant, real-time remittance delivery to Recipients;
   
(ii) Reducing cash handling costs and security risks for Hijrabank;
   
(iii) Creating ongoing wallet activity and transaction volume that benefits all parties;
   
(iv) Providing Recipients with multi-currency wallet functionality (USD + ETB holdings);
   
(v) Driving adoption of the CICO CASH Digital Wallet platform, which benefits CICO Financial Technologies (Hawilpay's sister company) and strengthens the integrated Hawilpay-CICO remittance corridor.

To recognize these benefits and ensure fair value distribution across the remittance ecosystem, the Parties agree:

(i) **Wallet Transaction Fees**: When Hijrabank charges transaction fees for wallet-based remittance payouts or subsequent wallet activities (transfers, bill payments, currency conversions, withdrawals, etc.), such fees shall be subject to revenue sharing with CICO Financial Technologies pursuant to the CICO SLA (50% CICO, 10% Operator Incentive, 40% Hijrabank). This revenue sharing compensates CICO for operating the wallet platform infrastructure.

(ii) **Fee Structure Encouragement**: While Hijrabank retains pricing authority under the CICO SLA, the Parties acknowledge that reasonable transaction fees for wallet services:
    - Align with industry standards for digital wallet operations;
    - Compensate CICO for platform development, hosting, and maintenance;
    - Provide sustainable economics for the tripartite relationship (Hawilpay-Hijrabank-CICO);
    - Should be balanced to promote wallet adoption while ensuring platform sustainability.

(iii) **Performance Monitoring**: Hijrabank shall provide quarterly reports to Hawilpay summarizing:
    - Number of remittances paid out via CICO CASH Digital Wallet;
    - Percentage of total remittances delivered via wallet vs. other methods;
    - Average wallet transaction fees charged (if any);
    - Wallet user retention and subsequent transaction activity.

(iv) **Strategic Alignment**: The Parties shall meet semi-annually to review wallet integration performance, user adoption trends, and fee structures to ensure the wallet payout channel remains commercially attractive for all parties in the ecosystem.

## **27\. Exchange Rate and Pricing Transparency**

**27.1 Hijrabank's Exchange Rate Responsibility**:

(a) **Bank Sets FX Rates**: The Parties acknowledge and agree that Hijrabank is solely responsible for setting the foreign exchange (FX) rate applied to remittance transactions for the conversion of USD to Ethiopian Birr (ETB). This authority extends to all payout methods, including cash pickups, bank account deposits, and credits to CICO CASH Digital Wallet accounts. Hawilpay does not set, control, or guarantee any exchange rates.

(b) **Rate Disclosure to Customers**: Hijrabank shall ensure that the exchange rate offered to recipients is clearly disclosed in accordance with National Bank of Ethiopia regulations and consumer protection requirements. Hijrabank is responsible for the competitiveness and transparency of the rates it offers.

(c) **FX Spread**: Any foreign exchange spread (the difference between the interbank or official NBE rate and the rate offered to recipients) shall be retained by Hijrabank as part of its revenue from remittance services, and shall not be subject to revenue sharing with Hawilpay under Section 3. This includes FX spread earned on immediate conversions (e.g., ETB wallet credits) and delayed conversions (e.g., USD wallet holdings subsequently converted to ETB within the CICO CASH Digital Wallet).

(d) **Consistency with CICO SLA**: The Parties acknowledge that Hijrabank's authority to set FX rates under this Agreement is consistent with Hijrabank's pricing authority under its Software Utilization Support & Maintenance License Agreement with CICO Financial Technologies. FX spread revenue is not subject to the revenue sharing provisions of the CICO SLA (which apply only to transaction fees, not FX spread).

**27.2 Transparency and Reporting**:

(a) **Monthly FX Performance Reports**: Hijrabank shall provide Hawilpay with monthly reports summarizing:
   - The average FX rate applied to remittance payouts during the month;
   - The official NBE reference rate for USD/ETB during the same period;
   - The average FX spread (expressed as a percentage);
   - Any customer complaints or disputes related to exchange rates.

(b) **Purpose of Reporting**: The FX performance reports are provided for informational purposes and to enable Hawilpay to monitor customer experience and market competitiveness. Hawilpay may use this information to provide feedback or suggestions to Hijrabank regarding market positioning, but has no authority to dictate or control Hijrabank's pricing.

**27.3 Competitive Pricing Commitment**:

(a) **Non-Exclusive Payout Partnership**: The Parties acknowledge and agree that Hawilpay's appointment of Hijrabank as a payout partner is non-exclusive. Hawilpay may partner with other banks or financial institutions in Ethiopia to provide payout services for Remittance Transactions initiated through the Hawilpay Platform.

(b) **Competitive Market Dynamics**: The Parties recognize that if Hawilpay partners with multiple payout institutions in Ethiopia:
   
(i) Recipients may have the ability to choose which payout institution to receive funds through;
   
(ii) Payout institutions (including Hijrabank) will compete on the basis of exchange rates, service quality, convenience, and other factors to attract Recipients;
   
(iii) Market forces will naturally incentivize competitive pricing and service quality among payout partners.

(c) **Market-Competitive Rates**: Hijrabank agrees to offer exchange rates that are commercially reasonable and competitive with:
   
(i) Other payout partners integrated with the Hawilpay Platform in Ethiopia (if any); and
   
(ii) Other remittance service providers operating in the Ethiopian market;

taking into account Hijrabank's costs, regulatory requirements, and business objectives.

(d) **Customer Experience**: The Parties acknowledge that customer satisfaction with the overall remittance service (including the exchange rate offered) is important to the success of the partnership and to Hijrabank's ability to attract Recipients in a competitive payout market. Hijrabank shall consider customer feedback and market conditions in setting its exchange rates.

(e) **Quarterly Pricing Review**: As part of the quarterly business reviews between the Parties, Hijrabank shall share information on its FX pricing strategy and any planned adjustments. Hawilpay shall provide market intelligence, including:
   
(i) Comparative exchange rates offered by other payout partners (if applicable);
   
(ii) Customer feedback on pricing and service quality;
   
(iii) Transaction volume trends and recipient preferences;
   
(iv) Market developments affecting competitiveness.

(f) **No Exclusivity Obligations**: Neither Party shall have any obligation to provide exclusive services to the other. Hijrabank acknowledges that Hawilpay may direct Recipients to alternative payout partners if Hijrabank's exchange rates, service quality, or other factors are not competitive. Similarly, Hawilpay shall not be obligated to direct any minimum volume or percentage of transactions to Hijrabank.

**27.4 Sender-Side Transparency (Hawilpay's Responsibility)**:

(a) **Total Cost Disclosure**: Hawilpay shall ensure that senders are clearly informed of the total cost of the remittance transaction, including any fees charged by Hawilpay (if applicable) and the exchange rate that will be applied by Hijrabank for payout in ETB.

(b) **Rate Quotation**: Hawilpay's platform shall display the exchange rate being offered by Hijrabank to senders before they confirm a transaction, along with an estimate of the amount the recipient will receive in ETB.

(c) **No Misleading Claims**: Neither Party shall make misleading claims about "zero fees" or "best rates" unless such claims are accurate and substantiated. All marketing materials shall comply with applicable consumer protection laws.

**27.5 No Hawilpay Liability for Exchange Rates**: Hijrabank acknowledges and agrees that Hawilpay has no liability for exchange rate fluctuations, FX spreads applied by Hijrabank, or any customer disputes arising from exchange rate discrepancies, except to the extent caused by Hawilpay's errors in transmitting rate information provided by Hijrabank.
