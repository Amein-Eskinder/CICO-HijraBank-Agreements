* **"Registered User"** means any wallet account created in the System, regardless of transaction activity or balance status. For billing purposes under Section 3.1, the monthly fee tier shall be determined by the total number of Registered Users at month-end. Registered Users include all accounts in the System database including active, inactive, dormant, suspended, or closed accounts. Only accounts that have been **permanently deleted** by the end-user (where all user data is removed from the System database in accordance with applicable data protection laws and the user's explicit deletion request) are excluded from the Registered User count. The Bank cannot unilaterally delete user accounts for billing purposes; account deletion can only occur upon the user's explicit request to permanently remove their account and data from the System.

* **“Active Subscriber”** means a registered wallet user who either (i) conducted at least one transaction during the billing month, or (ii) held a positive balance at any point during the billing month, as recorded in the System.

## **2\. License Grant and Scope of Work**

**2.1 License Grant:** Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and in consideration of the fees and payments described herein, CICO hereby grants to the Bank a non-exclusive, non-transferable, and limited License to access and use the System and the Documentation, as hosted and operated by CICO within the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, solely for the Bank’s internal banking and remittance operations and other business activities it is duly authorized to conduct. This License permits use of the System for up to **1,000,000 (one million) end-user accounts initially**, as further detailed in **Annex B (Scope of Work)**. The Bank shall not use the System to provide services to third parties outside of its own licensed banking business (including, without limitation, time-sharing, service-bureau, or resale arrangements) and shall not sublicense, assign, or otherwise transfer the System or this License to any third party except as expressly permitted under this Agreement.

For the avoidance of doubt, the License granted herein confers only a right of access and use of the hosted System and does not convey any ownership interest, source-code rights, or installation rights with respect to the underlying software or infrastructure managed by CICO.

**2.2 Scope of System Functionality:** The System licensed under this Agreement is a comprehensive digital multi-currency wallet and operator management platform supporting multi-channel financial services. **The System’s key modules and features include** (without limitation):

* **Multi-Channel Access:** Support for ATM, POS, USSD, Internet banking, Mobile banking, Agency banking, and branch banking channels, allowing The Bank’s customers to access the System services through various channels, including integrations with messaging platforms (e.g. Telegram and WhatsApp chatbots).

* **Core Payment Features:** Ability for end-users to send and transfer money, receive money, and make payments for goods and services using the digital wallet. This includes domestic money transfers and support for receiving international remittances.

* **Value-Added Services:** Functionality for airtime purchases (mobile top-up), bill payments (utilities, school fees, ticketing, etc.), and bulk payments (such as salary disbursements or distributions to beneficiaries).

* **Customer Onboarding:** Digital customer onboarding for different user types (Customers, Operators like Agents, and Merchants) with in-app capture of Know-Your-Customer (KYC) information and document uploads (e.g. ID cards, photographs).

* **Operators and Branchless Banking:** Support for branchless banking operations whereby customers can deposit or withdraw cash through operators like agents, and perform inter-account transfers without needing a branch visit.

* **Integrations:** A flexible integration framework to connect the System with The Bank's core banking system or other third-party systems, enabling inter-bank and inter-wallet transfers and other interoperability features. The Parties acknowledge that The Bank has entered into a Remittance Platform and Services Agreement with Hawilpay Inc. dated September 20, 2025, pursuant to which the System shall be integrated with the Hawilpay Platform to enable remittance payouts via Digital Wallet credits. CICO shall provide reasonable technical support to facilitate such integration, with any material custom development to be addressed via Change Request.

* **Digital Lending:** An integrated mobile lending platform with a built-in credit scoring and decision engine, enabling The Bank to offer Shariah-compliant financing to its customers, in accordance with applicable Islamic banking principles and regulatory requirements.

* **Equb (Rotating Savings) Module:** Functionality to digitize traditional informal savings groups (“Equb” or table banking), allowing group savings and lending activities.

* **Secure Aid Distribution:** Features for secure cash or aid distribution programs, including biometric and facial recognition support for beneficiary registration and verification, intended for NGOs or government cash transfer programs using the system voucher or NFC Cards.

* **Clearing and Settlement:** A robust clearing, reconciliation, and settlement module to handle multi-party transactions and financial institution settlements, ensuring accurate ledger postings and settlement between The Bank and other institutions or agents involved.

These features are provided as part of the licensed System as of the Effective Date. **Annex B (Scope of Work)** may contain a more detailed description of the System modules, any agreed customizations, and the implementation plan for deploying these features.

**2.3 Documentation:** CICO shall provide The Bank with one (1) electronic copy of the System Documentation in English, sufficient to enable The Bank’s personnel to understand, use, and operate the System. The Bank may make and distribute copies of the Documentation internally as necessary for its use of the System under this Agreement. CICO shall, from time to time, provide The Bank with any updates or revisions to the Documentation that correspond to updates, new releases, or modifications of the System delivered under this Agreement.

**2.4 Deployment and Hosting Site:** The System shall be deployed, hosted, and operated by CICO within a dedicated, secure, and fully-managed server environment located in CICO’s designated data center in Ethiopia (the “Deployment Site”). The Deployment Site shall constitute the Authorized Site for the purpose of receiving Support Services under this Agreement. CICO shall be solely responsible for procuring, maintaining, and managing all necessary hardware, operating system software, database licenses (including, without limitation, Oracle or MS SQL), network connectivity, and all other infrastructure components required for the System to operate in accordance with the Documentation. CICO warrants that the Deployment Site complies with all technical, security, environmental, and data-protection requirements prescribed in the Documentation and applicable Ethiopian regulations. The Parties further agree that all Customer Data shall be hosted exclusively within the territory of Ethiopia, in compliance with the Data Residency and Sovereignty provisions of Section 7.7 of this Agreement.

**2.5 Use Restrictions and Permitted Copies:** The Bank’s access to and use of the System shall be limited to the scope, number of user accounts, and functional modules expressly authorized under this Agreement and the applicable order schedule. The Bank shall not, directly or indirectly, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, modify, translate, or create derivative works based on the System or any part thereof, except to the extent expressly permitted by law or with CICO’s prior written consent. Because the System is hosted, operated, and managed exclusively by CICO within its designated data-center environment, The Bank is not permitted to install, copy, or replicate the System or any of its components on its own infrastructure or third-party servers.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, The Bank may:

* Download, export, or back up its own data generated or processed through the System, solely for archival or regulatory purposes; and  
* Retain copies of Documentation or related user materials provided by CICO for internal reference and training.

Any such data exports or documentation copies shall remain subject to all confidentiality, intellectual-property, and use restrictions set forth in this Agreement. The Bank shall maintain appropriate safeguards for all copies of Documentation and ensure that CICO’s proprietary notices and copyright legends are preserved on each copy.

**2.6 Cooperation and Access:** The Bank shall provide CICO with timely and reasonable access to relevant Bank personnel, systems interfaces, and operational information necessary for CICO to perform its implementation, integration, training, hosting, support, and maintenance obligations under this Agreement. Since the System is hosted and operated by CICO within its own secure data center, CICO shall not require direct physical access to the Bank’s facilities or infrastructure, except in cases where integration or on-site training activities specifically require such presence. In those cases, the Bank shall facilitate reasonable access to its premises, systems, or personnel during normal business hours (unless otherwise agreed for urgent or after-hours support), subject to the Bank’s applicable security and access control policies. The Bank agrees to cooperate in good faith with CICO by providing all necessary information, authorizations, and resources required to ensure effective implementation, smooth operation, and timely support of the System. Both Parties shall maintain open and continuous communication to resolve operational or technical issues efficiently and in accordance with the procedures set out in Annex H (Support and Escalation Matrix).

**2.7 Infrastructure and Connectivity Responsibilities:** CICO shall be responsible for procuring, configuring, and maintaining all hardware, operating system software, database management systems (RDBMS), network components, and third-party system software required for the operation of the System within the CICO-hosted environment. CICO shall ensure that all such infrastructure components are maintained under valid support and maintenance agreements with their respective vendors to ensure optimal uptime, performance, and security. The Bank shall be responsible for maintaining reliable internet connectivity and secure communication channels between its internal systems and the CICO-hosted environment, including user-side devices and branch terminals. The Bank shall also ensure that its users’ access points (including branch terminals, teller systems, or integration endpoints) comply with CICO’s security, authentication, and connectivity requirements as defined in the Documentation or Annex D. CICO shall implement and manage appropriate backup, archiving, disaster recovery, and security measures for the System and related infrastructure in accordance with industry best practices and applicable Ethiopian data-protection regulations.

**2.8 Co-Branding and Brand Identity:**

(a) **Brand Name**: The System shall be marketed, operated, and presented to end-users under the primary brand name **"CICO"** (the "**Brand Name**"). Hijra Bank's brand elements shall be displayed as a co-brand partner in Bank-specific channels and regulatory communications, reflecting the partnership between CICO as the technology provider and platform owner, and Hijra Bank as the licensed financial institution.

(b) **Brand Guidelines**: The Parties shall collaborate to establish brand guidelines for the System, including:
   
(i) Logo design with CICO as the primary brand, with Hijra Bank logo displayed in Bank-specific contexts;
   
(ii) Color schemes, fonts, and visual identity primarily reflecting CICO's brand standards, with Hijra Bank elements in appropriate contexts;
   
(iii) Marketing and promotional materials featuring the CICO brand prominently, with Hijra Bank identification as the banking partner;
   
(iv) User interface elements displaying the "CICO" brand as primary identity.

(c) **Brand Ownership**: The "CICO" brand and all System-related intellectual property, user interfaces, and marketing materials shall remain the exclusive property of CICO. Hijra Bank retains ownership of its own brand elements. Marketing materials that feature both brands shall be used only for the duration of this Agreement and with mutual approval. Upon termination, CICO retains all rights to the "CICO" brand and System materials, and Hijra Bank retains its own brand elements.

(d) **Customer-Facing Branding**: All customer-facing touchpoints shall display the "CICO" brand as the primary platform identity. Hijra Bank's brand elements shall be displayed in the following contexts to identify the banking partner:
   
(i) Login screens and account dashboard headers ("Powered by CICO for Hijra Bank customers");
   
(ii) Regulatory and compliance disclosures required by National Bank of Ethiopia;
   
(iii) Banking-specific functions (account statements, deposit confirmations, loan applications);
   
(iv) Customer service communications where banking license or regulatory matters are addressed;
   
(v) Physical branch materials and Bank-controlled marketing channels;
   
(vi) Co-branded marketing campaigns mutually approved per Section 2.8(e).
   
For clarity, the following shall display CICO brand primarily: mobile applications, web portal, USSD menus, SMS notifications, agent/operator applications, transaction interfaces, and promotional campaigns.

(e) **Brand Approval**: Neither Party shall use the co-branded identity or the other Party's individual brand elements in any manner not expressly permitted by this Agreement or approved in writing by the other Party. All marketing materials, press releases, and public communications featuring the co-brand shall be subject to mutual approval.

(f) **Regulatory Compliance**: The Bank acknowledges that as the licensed financial institution, it shall ensure that all branding and marketing of the System complies with National Bank of Ethiopia regulations and Ethiopian advertising standards.

**2.9 Additional Use Capacity:** The initial capacity of **1,000,000 (one million) registered users** referenced in Section 2.1 represents a **billing metric threshold**, not a technical system limitation. The System is technically capable of supporting registered users beyond this threshold. If The Bank's business growth results in exceeding 1,000,000 registered users, additional capacity licensing fees shall apply as set forth in the pricing schedule (ETB 5.00 per additional user as a one-time top-up fee), and the monthly AMS fees will continue to be calculated based on the applicable tier per Annex F. If The Bank requires additional functional modules or features not contemplated in the initial scope (as defined in Annex B), the Parties shall negotiate in good faith an amendment or addendum to this Agreement to license such additional modules, which may involve additional fees as appropriate.

**2.10 Channel Deployment and Third-Party Integrations:**

(a) **CICO's Channel Development Responsibilities:** As part of the System delivery and included in the implementation services and AMS Fees, CICO shall be responsible for developing, deploying, and maintaining the following customer-facing channels and interfaces:

  (i) **Mobile Applications:** Native mobile applications for iOS and Android platforms, including development, testing, branding (per Section 2.8), submission to Apple App Store and Google Play Store, and ongoing updates and maintenance. CICO shall procure and manage developer accounts for app stores under CICO's name (with appropriate Bank co-branding per Section 2.8), and shall handle app store compliance, versioning, and distribution.
  
  (ii) **USSD Channel:** Integration with USSD gateway providers to enable USSD menu-based access to the System. CICO shall develop the USSD application logic, menu structure, and backend integration. CICO shall procure and manage relationships with USSD gateway providers (such as telecommunications operators) and handle technical integration, testing, and maintenance of the USSD channel.
  
  (iii) **SMS Notifications:** Integration with SMS gateway providers to enable transactional SMS notifications, alerts, and promotional messages. CICO shall procure and manage relationships with SMS gateway service providers, handle API integration, message template management, and ensure reliable message delivery. Per Annex I, per-message SMS costs are pass-through costs charged to The Bank, but the gateway procurement, integration, and management are CICO's responsibility included in AMS Fees.
  
  (iv) **Web Portal:** Development and hosting of the web-based user interface for internet banking access, including responsive design for desktop and mobile browsers, user authentication, and all System functionality accessible via web.
  
  (v) **API Interfaces:** Development and documentation of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for integration with The Bank's core banking system, third-party payment networks (e.g., EthSwitch), remittance platforms (e.g., Hawilpay as referenced in Section 2.2), and other external systems as specified in the Scope of Work.

(b) **Third-Party Vendor Procurement:** CICO shall identify, evaluate, negotiate with, and procure agreements with third-party technology vendors and service providers necessary for the System's operation, including but not limited to:
  - USSD gateway providers (e.g., Ethio Telecom, Safaricom)
  - SMS gateway providers and aggregators
  - Payment switch providers (e.g., EthSwitch for interbank transactions)
  - Mobile app distribution platforms (Apple App Store, Google Play Store)
  - Cloud infrastructure providers (if applicable for disaster recovery or additional capacity)
  - Biometric and KYC verification service providers (if not provided by The Bank)
  
CICO shall manage these vendor relationships, ensure service quality, handle technical integrations, and monitor vendor performance. Where such vendor services result in per-transaction or per-message costs, these shall be treated as pass-through costs per Annex I and charged to The Bank accordingly. However, CICO's effort in vendor selection, procurement, integration, and ongoing management is included in the AMS Fees.

(c) **The Bank's Channel Responsibilities:** The Bank shall be responsible for:
  - Providing necessary regulatory approvals or licenses for deploying channels (e.g., mobile banking approval from National Bank of Ethiopia)
  - Providing brand assets, logos, and content for use in channels (per Section 2.8)
  - Approving channel designs, user flows, and user experience before launch
  - Handling first-level customer support inquiries related to channel usage (with CICO providing L2/L3 support for technical issues per Section 4)
  - Maintaining reliable internet connectivity from The Bank's premises and branches to CICO's hosted environment

(d) **Channel Ownership and Portability:** All mobile applications, web portals, USSD applications, and related software code developed by CICO shall remain the exclusive intellectual property of CICO per Section 6. The Bank receives only a right to use these channels during the term of this Agreement. Upon termination, CICO may continue to use, modify, and license the channel software to other clients. The Bank may request data export and limited transition assistance per Section 15.5(d), but shall not have rights to the underlying software code or channel infrastructure.

(e) **Channel Customization:** Standard channel features and user interfaces are included in the System as delivered. If The Bank requests material customization to channel design, user flows, or functionality beyond the standard System capabilities, such customization shall be handled via Change Request per Section 4 and may be subject to additional fees at ETB 5,000 per man-day or as otherwise agreed.

## **3\. Fees and Payment Terms**

**3.1 License and Service Fees:** In consideration for the License grant of the System and the provision of Maintenance & Support Services, The Bank shall pay fees to CICO in accordance with the following hybrid model of fixed fees and revenue sharing:

* **(a) Fixed Monthly Fee (Subscription Fee):** Starting from the Go-Live Date (Month 1), The Bank shall pay CICO a monthly fee based on the total number of Registered Users at month-end, in accordance with the SaaS Tier Pricing Schedule set forth in Annex F of this Agreement. The applicable monthly AMS Fee (also referred to as "Monthly Managed Fee" in the pricing schedule) covers The Bank's right to use the System, receive Support Services, managed operations, and benefit from all included upgrades and updates. Unless otherwise agreed, the AMS Fee shall be invoiced and paid monthly in advance. For clarity, the 12-month software warranty period referenced in Section 10.1 covers defect resolution only and does not waive the monthly AMS Fee; both the warranty and the monthly fee are in effect simultaneously from Go-Live.

  **Billing Cycle Definition:** For purposes of determining the applicable pricing tier, "month-end" means the count of Registered Users as of 11:59 PM East Africa Time (EAT) on the last calendar day of the billing month. The count shall be automatically captured by the System and included in monthly billing reports provided to The Bank for verification.

* **(b) Revenue Share Model:** In addition to the AMS Fee, CICO shall be entitled to a share of **Net Chargeable Transaction Fees** (as defined below) generated from all Chargeable Transactions processed through the System. The Parties agree that:  
  * The Bank shall retain **forty percent (40%)** of Net Chargeable Transaction Fees.  
  * CICO shall receive **fifty percent (50%)** of Net Chargeable Transaction Fees in real time.  
  * A further ten percent (10%) operator share shall be allocated in real time as incentives to **Operators** for facilitating cash-in, cash-out, and related services, thereby ensuring operator participation, retention, and service quality.

  For the purposes of calculating the Revenue Share:
  * **"Gross Transaction Fees"** means all fees or charges collected from end-users for Chargeable Transactions, exclusive of VAT and other indirect taxes.
  * **"Pass-Through Costs"** means third-party costs actually incurred and paid by CICO or The Bank in connection with processing transactions, as detailed in Annex I (Pass-Through Cost Structure). Pass-Through Costs are deducted before calculating revenue share.
  * **"Net Chargeable Transaction Fees"** means Gross Transaction Fees minus Pass-Through Costs.
  
  **Computation:** Net = Gross Fees – Pass-Through Costs → apply 50/10/40 split on Net.
  
  *Example:* Gross ETB 10.00 – Pass-Through ETB 2.00 = **Net ETB 8.00** → CICO 4.00, Operator 0.80, Bank 3.20.

* **(c) Transition & Applicability:** The AMS (Application Maintenance Services) Fee and the Revenue Share shall operate concurrently, unless otherwise agreed in writing. The AMS Fee covers licensing, maintenance, and support services, while the Revenue Share represents CICO’s participation in the transactional revenues enabled by the System, For clarity, **Revenue Share is calculated on end-user transaction fees and is independent of AMS Fees**; neither offsets the other unless agreed in writing.

* **(d) Settlement of Revenue Share:** Revenue shares due to CICO shall be credited in **real time** from each Chargeable Transaction, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties. Where a monthly settlement is adopted, The Bank shall provide a statement of Chargeable Transaction revenues for the prior month by the **15th business day** of each month and concurrently remit CICO’s share. The Bank shall implement tracking and reporting mechanisms within the System to accurately capture the revenues subject to sharing, and CICO shall have the right to audit such reports as reasonably necessary.

* **(e) No Cap on AMS Fees:** For clarity, the monthly AMS Fees shall remain payable in accordance with the SaaS Tier Pricing Schedule regardless of transactional volumes, and the obligation to pay the Revenue Share shall continue throughout the Term of the Agreement. There is no cap or substitution mechanism whereby AMS Fees are replaced by revenue share; both apply as distinct obligations unless expressly modified by written amendment.

* **(f) Proration for Partial Months:** If the Service commencement date (Go-Live Date for AMS fees, which begins Month 13) or termination date occurs mid-month, the AMS Fee for that partial month shall be prorated on a daily basis, calculated as: (Monthly AMS Fee ÷ Number of days in that calendar month) × Actual days of service provided. For the avoidance of doubt, the Registered User count used for tier determination shall be the count as of the service termination date for a partial final month.

**3.2 Maintenance and Support Fees:** The Monthly AMS Fees described in Section 3.1(a) and Annex F, together with the applicable Revenue Share, shall constitute full and complete compensation for all Hosting, Maintenance, Support Services, and Managed Operations provided under this Agreement. There shall be no separate annual maintenance or hosting fee charged to the Bank. CICO warrants that, during the Term of this Agreement and provided the Bank remains current on all payments due, the Bank shall be entitled to receive, without additional charge beyond the fees described herein, all standard:

* **Hosting & Security Services:** Ethiopia-resident hosting, 24/7 monitoring, backups/disaster recovery, patching, infrastructure management, server monitoring, and security administration at the CICO Data Center;

* **Application Maintenance:** Bug fixes, patches, minor enhancements, version upgrades, performance enhancements, and new releases of the System;

* **Support Operations:** L1/L2/L3 helpdesk (voice/email/chat), incident management, root cause analysis (RCA), technical troubleshooting, knowledge base & FAQs;

* **Customer Operations:** Customer onboarding/KYC workflow execution & education, digital customer registration support;

* **Operator/Agent Operations:** Operator and agent onboarding & training coordination, field playbooks, performance nudges and performance management;

* **Marketing Operations:** Campaign setup & execution, CRM segmentation, in-app promotions, field activations (Note: media spend for marketing campaigns is a pass-through cost per Annex I and is not included in the AMS Fee);

* **Reporting & Governance:** KPI dashboards (real-time access via admin portal), monthly service reviews (operational performance, incidents, resolutions), quarterly roadmap planning and updates (platform enhancements, new features), **quarterly marketing plans** (CICO shall present proposed marketing campaigns, budgets, and calendar to The Bank for review and approval each quarter), and monthly marketing performance reports (campaign ROI, user acquisition costs, engagement metrics).

CICO further warrants that hosting, support, and managed operations services shall be performed in accordance with industry best practices, the Service Level Objectives specified in this Agreement, and the data-residency provisions set forth in Section 7.7.

**3.2.1 Marketing Campaign Categories:**

For purposes of this Agreement, marketing campaigns are categorized as follows:

(a) **Go-To-Market (GTM) Campaigns:** Major launch or relaunch campaigns for System deployment, new feature releases, or major market initiatives. GTM campaigns typically include:
  - Market research and positioning strategy
  - Brand launch creative development
  - Multi-channel media buying (TV, radio, digital, outdoor)
  - Launch events and activations
  - Influencer or partnership activations
  - PR and media relations
  
GTM campaigns are subject to quarterly planning and Bank approval as specified in Section 3.2.2.

(b) **Operational/Tactical Campaigns:** Ongoing campaigns to drive user acquisition, engagement, retention, or transaction volume. Operational campaigns include:

Operational campaigns with total cost (including media spend) under thirty percent (30%) of that month's applicable Monthly Managed Fee may be executed by CICO with written notification to The Bank but without requiring prior approval, provided they align with the approved quarterly marketing plan themes and budgets. For example, if the Monthly Managed Fee for that month is ETB 450,000 (500K-1M registered users tier), operational campaigns under ETB 135,000 (30% of ETB 450,000) may proceed with notification only.

(c) **Always-On Marketing Activities:** Routine marketing operations included in AMS Fees with no additional cost:
  - Social media management and community engagement
  - Customer education content (tutorials, FAQs, guides)
  - Email newsletters and updates
  - Basic in-app messaging and tips
  - Performance monitoring and reporting
  - Campaign analytics and optimization
  
These activities do not require Bank approval and are executed by CICO as part of managed operations.

**3.2.2 Quarterly Marketing Planning Process:**

(a) **Proposal Submission:** No later than fifteen (15) business days before the start of each calendar quarter, CICO shall submit to The Bank a Quarterly Marketing Plan comprising:
  - Proposed GTM campaigns (if any)
  - Operational campaign calendar and themes
  - Estimated budgets by campaign and media type
  - Target KPIs (user acquisition, transaction volume, engagement, retention)
  - Recommended media buying strategy
  - Timeline and key milestones

(b) **Bank Review Period:** The Bank shall review and provide feedback or approval within ten (10) business days of receiving the Quarterly Marketing Plan. Approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(c) **Approval Deemed Granted:** If The Bank does not respond within the ten (10) business day review period, the Quarterly Marketing Plan shall be deemed approved and CICO may proceed with execution.

(d) **Budget Modifications:** If The Bank requests material changes to the proposed plan or budgets, the Parties shall meet to discuss and agree on a revised plan within five (5) business days. If no agreement is reached, CICO may proceed with operational campaigns as planned under the 30% threshold specified in Section 3.2.1(b), but GTM campaigns exceeding ETB 200,000 shall be deferred until mutual agreement is reached.

(e) **In-Quarter Adjustments:** CICO may propose tactical or reactive campaigns during the quarter to capitalize on market opportunities or respond to competitive actions. Such proposals with total cost under ETB 100,000 require Bank approval within three (3) business days; if no response is received within three business days, approval is deemed granted and CICO may proceed with execution.

(f) **Annual Marketing Budget:** The Parties shall agree on an indicative annual media spend budget at the start of each calendar year or contract year. This budget serves as a guideline for quarterly planning and may be adjusted quarterly based on business performance, competitive dynamics, and strategic priorities.

**3.3 Taxes:** All fees and payments stated in this Agreement are exclusive of applicable taxes. Each Party shall bear and be responsible for its own taxes in accordance with applicable law. For clarity: (i) CICO shall be responsible for any taxes imposed on its income; and (ii) the Bank shall be responsible for value-added tax (VAT), sales tax, or other consumption taxes applicable to the services it receives under this Agreement. If any withholding or deduction is required by law on payments to CICO, the Bank may deduct such tax from the payments due, provided that it supplies CICO with official receipts and documentation evidencing payment of the tax to the relevant authorities and takes all reasonable steps to minimize such withholding in accordance with applicable law or tax treaties.

**3.4 Invoicing and Payment Procedures:** CICO shall issue invoices to The Bank for the fees payable under this Agreement as follows:

* **Monthly AMS Fees** shall be invoiced and payable **monthly in advance** based on the applicable subscriber tier.

* **Revenue Share** (including the Operator Incentive portion) shall be calculated in real time. Where monthly settlement applies, CICO shall issue invoices **monthly in arrears** based on reported Chargeable Transaction revenues.

The Bank shall pay each valid invoice within **thirty (30) calendar days** of the invoice date, unless otherwise specified in Annex E or agreed in writing. Payments shall be made in **Ethiopian Birr (ETB)** to CICO’s designated bank account. If the Parties mutually agree, payments may alternatively be settled in another country and in another currency at the prevailing exchange rate, subject to applicable law and regulator approvals.

**3.5 Audit of Revenue and Costs:** The Bank shall maintain complete and accurate records of all Chargeable Transactions and associated revenues in sufficient detail to enable the proper calculation of fees payable to CICO, including the Revenue Share. CICO shall have the right, at its own expense and with reasonable notice, to audit such records of The Bank during normal business hours, not more than once per calendar year, solely for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of revenue share payments. Similarly, CICO shall maintain complete and accurate records of all Pass-Through Costs and vendor invoices in sufficient detail to enable proper verification of cost allocations, and The Bank shall have the right, at its own expense and with reasonable notice, to audit such records of CICO during normal business hours, not more than once per calendar year, solely for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of pass-through cost allocations. All information learned or accessed by either Party in the course of any audit shall be treated as the other Party's Confidential Information and shall not be used for any purpose other than verifying compliance with this Agreement.

**3.6 No Other Fees:** Except for the **AMS Fees, Revenue Share, and Operator Incentive** expressly set forth in this Agreement, The Bank shall not be obligated to pay any other license fee, subscription fee, or annual maintenance fee for the System. Any services beyond the agreed Scope of Work—such as significant custom development, on-site professional services, or third-party integrations not covered herein—may be provided by CICO at The Bank’s request subject to a separate **Change Request** and a mutually agreed written addendum or work order. Such additional services may be charged on a **time-and-materials basis** at the prevailing daily rate (**ETB 5,000 per man-day**) or at a fixed price, as agreed in writing prior to commencement of work.

## **4\. Support and Maintenance Services**

CICO shall provide to The Bank comprehensive software support and maintenance services for the System throughout the term of this Agreement, in accordance with the following provisions and the detailed Service Level Agreement attached hereto as **Annex A** (the “**SLA**”):

* **(a) Scope of Support:** CICO will provide helpdesk support, technical assistance, and issue resolution for the System. The Bank’s authorized staff may report System issues or seek assistance via designated support channels (phone, email, or support portal) as specified in the SLA. CICO shall make skilled support personnel available to answer questions and resolve problems related to the System’s operation, configuration, and functionality. Support will be provided during Normal Working Hours (as defined in the SLA, e.g., 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM on business days) and, for critical issues, on a 24/7 basis as needed per the SLA severity definitions.

* **(b) Issue Resolution and Bug Fixes:** CICO shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly diagnose and correct any verifiable errors, bugs, or defects in the System reported by The Bank that cause the System to deviate from its documented specifications. **Bug fixes** or workarounds will be provided in accordance with the response and resolution times set forth in the SLA (with higher-severity issues such as System unavailability being addressed with top priority). CICO shall keep The Bank informed of the status of problem resolution and shall provide interim solutions or bypasses to mitigate the impact of issues until a permanent fix is available.

* **(c) Updates and New Releases:** As part of the Support Services, and at no additional license cost beyond the AMS Fees to The Bank, CICO shall provide The Bank with all **updates, upgrades, patches, and new releases** of the System that CICO makes generally available to its customers during the term of this Agreement. New releases (versions) may include enhancements or new features to the core System. CICO will notify The Bank of the availability of any such updates or new releases and, if requested by The Bank, will plan, schedule, and perform the installation of the updates pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The installation of major new versions may be scheduled in coordination with The Bank to minimize disruption. Any new module or product that is not part of the System as defined in Section 2 (and which CICO offers for separate licensing) would be subject to a separate agreement or addendum if The Bank elects to license it.

* **(d) Service Level Agreement (SLA):** The Parties shall execute and adhere to a detailed SLA (Annex A) that defines support procedures, issue severity levels, response and resolution time commitments, and performance metrics for the Support Services. The SLA will cover, among other things, definitions of **Critical** vs **Non-Critical** issues, target response times (e.g., initial response within 30 minutes for critical issues), and escalation procedures. The SLA shall be considered an integral part of this Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the SLA and this Agreement, this Agreement shall govern, except with respect to the specific support metrics and processes, in which case the SLA shall govern.

* **(e) The Bank’s Support Obligations:** The Bank shall provide all information and assistance reasonably required by CICO to reproduce, troubleshoot, and resolve reported issues. This includes providing detailed error descriptions, screenshots or logs, and remote access to the System (or on-site access, if necessary and feasible) for CICO’s support engineers. The Bank shall also designate a reasonable number of trained employees or representatives who will be the primary liaisons with CICO’s support team (often referred to as “key contacts”), and through whom all support communications will be channeled. The Bank is responsible for first-level support to its own end-users and operators; issues that cannot be resolved or questions that cannot be answered by The Bank’s internal IT support can be escalated to CICO.

* **(f) Customizations and Change Requests:** If The Bank requests a modification or enhancement to the System that is outside the scope of standard maintenance (a “Customization”), CICO will evaluate such request and, if feasible, provide The Bank with a written proposal or Change Request detailing the technical approach, any impact on the System, the timeline, and any additional cost. No Customization will be undertaken by CICO unless and until the Parties agree in writing on the scope and any associated fees (at a rate of ETB 5,000 per man-day for development services). Minor configuration changes that can be achieved via provided toolkits or settings in the System (as opposed to source code changes) will be accommodated by CICO as part of support when reasonable. Customizations developed for The Bank will be subject to the Intellectual Property terms of Section 6, unless otherwise agreed.

  **Configuration Scope Definitions:**
  
  **Minor Configuration** (included at no additional charge as part of support services): User role and permission adjustments via admin console; workflow parameter changes using configuration tools; report template customizations using provided report builder; logo, branding, and color scheme updates; email and SMS template modifications; fee structure updates in configuration tables; language translations and localization adjustments; dashboard widget arrangements and display preferences.

  **Major Configuration/Customization** (billed as custom development per Change Request): Source code modifications or custom code development; database schema changes or new table creation; new API endpoints or integration development; custom module or feature development beyond existing functionality; third-party system integrations not included in the original scope; changes requiring regression testing or system-wide impact assessment; custom reporting modules requiring database queries or new data models.

* **(g) Training and Knowledge Transfer:** As part of the implementation and support, CICO shall provide an initial “train-the-trainer” program to instruct The Bank’s designated personnel in the use and operation of the System. Thereafter, during the term of the Agreement, CICO shall make training materials available and provide additional training sessions upon reasonable request (which may be subject to additional fees if outside the originally scoped training days). The Bank is responsible for training its end-users, staff and operators (after receiving the trainer training from CICO), but CICO will reasonably cooperate by providing guidance and documentation.

* **(h) Performance and Security Monitoring:** CICO shall be fully responsible for the continuous performance, availability, and security monitoring of the System within the CICO-hosted environment. CICO shall implement automated tools and procedures to proactively detect, analyze, and respond to performance degradation, intrusion attempts, and other anomalies that may affect System stability or data integrity. CICO shall promptly notify the Bank of any security incidents, performance degradations, or detected vulnerabilities that could impact the Bank’s use of the System and shall take all necessary corrective actions in accordance with the incident response timelines defined in Annex H (Support and Escalation Matrix).

* **(i) Exclusions:** The Maintenance & Support Services provided by CICO under this Agreement do not cover issues or errors caused by: (i) misuse or unauthorized modifications of the System by The Bank, (ii) third-party hardware or software failures (including database or OS issues not caused by the System), or (iii) use of the System in violation of this Agreement. If CICO’s support efforts determine that a reported problem was due to one of the above causes, CICO may charge The Bank on a time-and-materials basis for the time spent in investigation and resolution, after notifying The Bank and obtaining consent to continue support on that paid basis.

* **(j) Change Management and Maintenance Windows:** CICO shall manage all System changes, maintenance activities, and updates in accordance with formal change management procedures designed to ensure operational continuity and minimize disruption to the Bank’s services. For any planned maintenance (including version upgrades, infrastructure enhancements, or scheduled downtime), CICO shall provide the Bank with not less than seventy-two (72) hours’ advance written notice, specifying the scope and expected duration of such activity. In the case of emergency maintenance or security patching required to address critical vulnerabilities, service disruptions, or compliance issues, CICO may act immediately and will provide the Bank with expedited notice consistent with the communication protocols and escalation timelines defined in Annex H (Support and Escalation Matrix). All maintenance activities shall be performed in accordance with the Service Level Objectives of this Agreement.

## **5\. Responsibilities of the Parties**

**5.1 The Bank’s Responsibilities.** The Bank agrees to perform the following obligations in connection with the implementation and ongoing use of the System:

* **(a) Requirements and Scope Definition:** The Bank has provided CICO with all necessary business requirements, specifications, and information needed to configure or customize the System for the Bank’s operations. These requirements are fully documented in the Business Requirements Specification (BRS) and Scope of Work (Annex B), which together form an integral part of this Agreement. Annex B (Scope of Work) and Annex C (Implementation Schedule) set out the definitive tasks, deliverables, and timelines for the project. No additional customizations, integrations, or scope changes shall be required of CICO unless agreed in writing by both Parties through a formal amendment to this Agreement.

* **(b) User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** The Bank is responsible for conducting thorough User Acceptance Testing of the System (including any customizations) before go-live. The Bank shall develop UAT test plans and test cases (with guidance from CICO as needed) and allocate qualified personnel to perform the testing. The Bank will verify the accuracy and completeness of the implementation by executing the test plans, documenting results, and reporting any issues to CICO in writing. CICO shall assist in resolving any identified issues in accordance with the support terms. The Bank’s written confirmation of successful UAT (or commencement of live operations) will signify acceptance of the System deliverables, subject to any outstanding issues documented at that time.

* **(c) Data Preparation:** The Bank shall prepare any necessary data (such as master data for customers, operators, products, or account balances) required to initialize or configure the System. The Bank will also be responsible for data migration from its legacy systems if applicable, with support or tools from CICO as agreed in the Scope of Work. It is The Bank’s responsibility to ensure the quality and accuracy of any data it provides or migrates into the System.

* **(d) Infrastructure and Third-Party Integration:** The Bank will provide and manage all third-party systems or interfaces that the System needs to connect with (such as core banking systems, payment gateways, SMS gateways, etc.), unless explicitly included in CICO’s deliverables. The Bank shall furnish any necessary APIs, network access, or credentials for such integrations and coordinate with third-party providers as required. The Bank will ensure that third-party components are available and responsive according to the implementation timeline.

* **(e) Project Management and Resources:** The Bank shall assign a project manager or coordinator who will act as the primary point of contact for CICO during the implementation project. The Bank will also assign knowledgeable staff or subject matter experts from relevant business units (operations, IT, compliance, etc.) to collaborate with CICO’s team, provide inputs, attend training, and make timely decisions to facilitate the project. The Bank is responsible for its internal project activities such as arranging user training sessions (after being trained by CICO), performing internal process changes, and ensuring management engagement for the project’s success.

* **(f) Compliance and Regulatory Approvals:** The Bank is responsible for obtaining any regulatory approvals, licenses, or notifications required for deploying and using the System for its financial services (for example, approval from the National Bank of Ethiopia for electronic banking services, if applicable). The Bank must ensure that its use of the System and the services provided to its customers via the System are in compliance with all relevant laws and regulations (though CICO will design the System to meet general industry standards, The Bank must configure it to comply with its specific regulatory requirements).

* **(g) Operational Use and End-User Support:** After go-live, The Bank is responsible for operating the System in accordance with the Documentation and training provided. The Bank will create its own internal helpdesk or support process for its end-users and operators, to handle first-level support queries or issues. Issues that are determined to be System defects or that require CICO’s involvement will be escalated to CICO’s support under Section 4. The Bank’s personnel should use reasonable efforts to confirm that an issue is not due to user error, data issues, or external systems before escalation.

* **(h) Security and Misuse Prevention:** The Bank shall use the System in a secure manner and implement policies to prevent unauthorized access or misuse of the System. The Bank is responsible for safeguarding user credentials, managing user access rights within the System, and ensuring that its employees and operators use the System in accordance with this Agreement. CICO will promptly notify The Bank of any known or suspected security breaches or incidents involving the System so that appropriate measures can be taken (see also Section 9 on Security).

**5.2 CICO’s Responsibilities.** CICO agrees to perform the following obligations in connection with the implementation and support of the System:

* **(a) Implementation Services:** CICO shall provide professional services to implement and configure the System in accordance with the agreed Scope of Work and Project Schedule (Annex C). These services include project management, business analysis, configuration/customization of the System, data migration assistance, integration setup, and technical and operational consulting as needed during the implementation. CICO will deploy a team with the necessary expertise (e.g., business consultants, technical consultants, trainers) to deliver the Implementation Services and will use the Project Schedule as a baseline for managing tasks and timelines. CICO shall exercise due skill, care, and diligence in performing these services and will adhere to generally accepted project management practices (for example, aligning with PMI or similar methodologies adapted to the project).

* **(b) Training:** CICO shall conduct “train-the-trainer” sessions and/or administrator training for The Bank’s designated personnel and operators, to ensure The Bank can effectively use and manage the System. CICO will provide training materials and hands-on training covering the System’s features, configuration options, and operational procedures. Training will be conducted in English (unless otherwise agreed) and may be delivered on-site or via remote conferencing tools, as appropriate. CICO shall ensure its trainers are knowledgeable about the System and can address The Bank’s questions during the training period.

* **(c) Regulatory and Compliance Support:** CICO will use its expertise to configure the System in a manner that supports The Bank’s compliance needs (to the extent such needs have been communicated in the requirements). This includes providing features for KYC data capture, transaction monitoring capabilities, audit logs, and other controls typically required in the financial industry. While The Bank is responsible for ensuring regulatory compliance, CICO shall, within the scope of the System’s design, make reasonable modifications or provide guidance to help The Bank meet any specific compliance requirements that arise (subject to Change Requests billed at ETB 5,000 per man-day, or a fixed fee as agreed).

* **(d) Performance of Services:** CICO shall perform all its services under this Agreement in a professional and workmanlike manner, using personnel with the requisite qualifications and experience. CICO’s team will comply with The Bank’s reasonable workplace rules and security policies when working at The Bank’s site. CICO will regularly update The Bank on project progress and will promptly inform The Bank of any issues or risks that could affect the timeline or success of the project. CICO shall cooperate fully with The Bank and any third-party contractors of The Bank to ensure smooth integration of the System with other components of The Bank’s environment.

* **(e) Support and Maintenance:** Following the implementation and the Go Live Date, CICO will provide ongoing Hosting, Maintenance & Support Services as described in Section 4\. Such services are fully covered under the AMS Fees and the Revenue Share model. CICO shall maintain a support organization capable of providing timely support to The Bank and shall meet the service levels committed in the SLA. CICO will also maintain the currency and quality of the System by releasing updates/upgrades as needed and ensuring those releases are made available to The Bank.

* **(f) Data Protection:** In performing the services and in any handling of Customer Data, CICO shall comply with the data protection and security obligations set forth in Section 7 and Section 9 of this Agreement. CICO’s personnel (including any subcontractors involved in support or development) will abide by confidentiality obligations and any applicable secrecy laws relevant to The Bank’s industry.

* **(g) No Disruption:** CICO shall use reasonable care to avoid causing any disruption to The Bank’s business operations during implementation, migration, or support activities. Where any downtime or service interruption is necessary (for example, to deploy an update), CICO will coordinate with The Bank to schedule such work at a mutually convenient time, and shall give sufficient advance notice to allow The Bank to prepare.

* **(h) Documentation of Changes:** CICO will document any customizations, configurations or changes made specifically for The Bank’s instance of the System, to the extent such information is not already covered in the standard Documentation. This is to ensure The Bank has a reference for any unique setup in its environment and to facilitate maintenance and future upgrades.

## **6\. Intellectual Property Rights**

**6.1 Ownership of System and Intellectual Property:** The Parties acknowledge and agree that **all Intellectual Property Rights in and to the System, the Documentation, and any software, modules, or materials provided by CICO under this Agreement are and shall remain the exclusive property of CICO** (or its third-party licensors, if any). Except for the License expressly granted to The Bank in Section 2.1, nothing in this Agreement transfers or assigns to The Bank any ownership rights in the System or related Intellectual Property. Any modifications, enhancements, new versions, or derivative works of the System (including those resulting from Customizations performed by CICO for The Bank) shall be the sole property of CICO and subject to the same Intellectual Property Rights as the original System. The Bank’s rights to use any such modifications or new releases are granted as part of the License, subject to the terms of this Agreement.

**6.2 The Bank’s Materials:** All Intellectual Property Rights in any materials, data, or content supplied by The Bank to CICO for the purposes of configuration or integration (for example, The Bank’s logos, branding elements, or proprietary business processes documented by The Bank) shall remain the property of The Bank. To the extent necessary for CICO to perform its obligations (such as incorporating The Bank’s logo into the System’s interface for co-branding purposes), The Bank grants CICO a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use such materials for the term of this Agreement for the sole purpose of providing the System and services to The Bank.

**6.3 No Third-Party Infringement:** CICO represents that, to the best of its knowledge, it has all necessary rights to license the System and Documentation to The Bank and that The Bank’s use of the System as permitted by this Agreement will not infringe upon any third party’s Intellectual Property Rights. In the event any third party asserts a claim that the System (in unmodified form as provided by CICO) infringes their patent, copyright, trademark or other IP rights, CICO shall defend The Bank against such claim and hold The Bank harmless from any damages or costs awarded by a court of final jurisdiction, provided that The Bank: **(i)** promptly notifies CICO in writing of the claim, **(ii)** allows CICO sole control of the defense and any settlement negotiations, and **(iii)** cooperates with CICO (at CICO’s expense) in the defense. This obligation of CICO (intellectual property indemnification) is a fundamental part of the IP Rights clause. If the System is found to infringe or if CICO believes it may infringe, CICO may, at its option, either obtain for The Bank the right to continue using the System, or modify/replace the infringing component to make it non-infringing without materially reducing functionality. If neither of those options is commercially feasible, CICO may terminate the License for the infringing part and refund to The Bank any prepaid fees covering the unused portion of the term for that part, whereupon The Bank will cease using that part. **This Section 6.3 states the entire liability of CICO and exclusive remedy of The Bank with respect to any intellectual property infringement claim.**

**6.4 Licensee Obligations:** The Bank acknowledges that the System and Documentation contain valuable proprietary information and trade secrets of CICO. The Bank shall not remove, obscure, or alter any copyright, trademark, or proprietary notices affixed to the System or Documentation. The Bank shall ensure that all users of the System within its organization are aware of and comply with the usage restrictions and confidentiality obligations in this Agreement. The Bank shall be liable for any breach of Intellectual Property Rights or misuse of the System by its employees, operators, or contractors as if such breach were committed by The Bank itself.

**6.5 Feedback:** If The Bank or its users provide CICO with any suggestions, feedback or ideas for improvements or enhancements to the System (“Feedback”), CICO shall be free to use and incorporate such Feedback in its products without obligation to The Bank. Any such Feedback, even if designated as proprietary or confidential by The Bank, shall not create any confidentiality obligation for CICO unless otherwise agreed. The Bank hereby grants CICO a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use and incorporate into the System any Feedback provided by The Bank or its personnel.

## **7\. Data Protection and Privacy**

**7.1 Compliance with Data Protection Laws:** Each Party shall comply with all applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations in performing its obligations under this Agreement. This includes, without limitation, Ethiopia’s data protection and privacy laws and regulations, and to the extent applicable, the **General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679, “GDPR”)** and other international data protection standards. The Bank, as a financial institution, remains responsible for complying with banking secrecy and customer data privacy laws governing its operations, and CICO shall cooperate to enable such compliance.

**7.2 Roles of the Parties (Controller and Processor):** The Parties acknowledge that, in relation to any personal data (as defined by applicable law) within The Bank’s Customer Data processed through the System, **The Bank is the data controller** (or analogous role under applicable law) determining the purposes and means of processing such personal data. CICO, in providing the System and related services, acts as a **data processor** on behalf of The Bank with respect to Customer Data. CICO shall process personal data contained in Customer Data only on documented instructions from The Bank and strictly for the purposes of fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement (except where otherwise required by law, in which case CICO will inform The Bank of that legal requirement prior to processing, unless law prohibits such notice on important grounds of public interest).

**7.3 Use and Access to Customer Data:** CICO shall not access or use The Bank’s Customer Data except as necessary to provide the System and Support Services to The Bank, or as explicitly authorized by The Bank. CICO shall not use Customer Data for its own purposes, and shall not disclose Customer Data to any third party except: **(i)** to CICO’s sub-contractors or partners who are bound by similar confidentiality and data protection obligations and only to the extent needed to support or improve the System (for example, a cloud hosting provider or an analytics sub-processor, if any, which in this Agreement are considered part of CICO’s responsibilities), **(ii)** as required by law or by a valid court or governmental order (in which case CICO shall, to the extent legally permissible, promptly notify The Bank and cooperate with The Bank’s efforts to limit or contest the disclosure), or **(iii)** with The Bank’s prior written consent.

**7.4 Data Security Measures:** Each Party shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect personal data and Customer Data against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, damage, theft, alteration, or disclosure. Such measures shall be in accordance with **industry standards** and **international best practices** (for example, ISO/IEC 27001 standards for information security management, or equivalent), taking into account the sensitivity of the data and the risks involved in processing. At a minimum, CICO shall ensure that Customer Data is protected by measures including access controls (limiting data access to personnel who need it for support), encryption of data in transit (e.g., using TLS 1.3 preferred, TLS 1.2 minimum for communications) and at rest where feasible, regular security testing and vulnerability assessments of the System, and robust network security controls at any location where Customer Data is processed or stored.

**7.5 Personal Data Breach:** In the event of any confirmed **personal data breach** (as defined in GDPR or equivalent notions in other laws) involving Customer Data processed by CICO — for example, any unauthorized access to or disclosure of The Bank’s Customer Data while in CICO’s custody — CICO shall promptly, and in any event **within 48 hours of discovery** (or earlier if required by applicable law), notify The Bank of the breach. Such notice will include all available details to help The Bank meet any obligations to notify regulators or individuals, such as the nature of the data involved, the known or suspected cause, the likely consequences, and the measures taken or proposed by CICO to address the breach and mitigate its effects. CICO will immediately take appropriate action to contain, investigate, and remedy the breach, and will keep The Bank informed of updates. CICO shall also reasonably assist The Bank in notifying the relevant supervisory authority and affected data subjects, if The Bank is required to do so by law.

**7.6 Data Subject Rights:** If CICO receives any request from an individual (data subject) or a supervisory authority to access, correct, delete or stop processing personal data contained in Customer Data, CICO shall promptly inform The Bank and shall not respond to such request except on The Bank’s documented instructions. CICO shall provide reasonable assistance to The Bank, by appropriate technical and organizational measures and at The Bank’s request, in fulfilling its obligations to respond to data subjects’ requests to exercise their rights under data protection laws (such as rights of access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, or objection), to the extent that such requests relate to the Customer Data processed by CICO. The Bank shall be responsible for handling and responding to all such requests, and for determining whether any exemptions apply; CICO’s assistance shall be charged at its reasonable time and materials rates if the effort is significant and not caused by any breach by CICO.

**7.7 Data Transfers:** The Parties agree that Customer Data will be hosted **in Ethiopia**. CICO shall not transfer or permit access to Customer Data outside of Ethiopia unless it has obtained The Bank’s prior written consent and ensured that such transfer is made in compliance with applicable data export and privacy laws. If, for support purposes, remote access by CICO’s personnel outside Ethiopia is required (for example, a developer located abroad needs to troubleshoot an issue), CICO will ensure that any personal data accessed remains protected in line with this Agreement and, if required by GDPR, that an appropriate data transfer mechanism (such as standard contractual clauses or another lawful basis) is in place to cover such access.

**7.8 Data Retention and Deletion:** Customer Data shall remain the property of The Bank. CICO acknowledges that it is holding any Customer Data solely on behalf of The Bank. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement (or upon The Bank’s written request at any time), CICO shall return to The Bank all Customer Data in its possession or control in a commonly readable electronic format, and/or securely delete or destroy all copies of Customer Data in its systems (except for copies required to be retained by law, or securely stored backups which shall remain protected under the terms of this Agreement and deleted in the normal course of backup rotation). CICO shall certify in writing its compliance with the deletion requirements of this clause upon The Bank’s request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CICO may retain anonymized or aggregated information (stripped of personal data and any identifiers of The Bank or its operators) for statistical or product improvement purposes, provided that such information cannot be linked to The Bank or any individual and no Confidential Information of The Bank is disclosed.

**7.9 Additional Data Processing Agreement:** The Parties may, if required by certain data protection laws (such as GDPR Article 28), sign a more detailed Data Processing Agreement (**DPA**) or incorporate standard data protection clauses, which shall supplement and be made part of this Agreement. In case of any conflict between such DPA and this Section 7, the terms of the DPA (if executed) shall prevail to the extent of the conflict, as it is intended to specifically govern personal data handling.

## **8\. Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure**

**8.1 Non-Disclosure Obligations:** Each Party, as a Receiving Party of the other’s Confidential Information, shall: **(a)** keep the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information strictly confidential and use at least the same degree of care to protect it as it uses to protect its own confidential information of similar sensitivity (but in no event less than reasonable care); **(b)** not disclose or permit access to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to any third party, except to its own or its Affiliates’ employees, officers, directors, agents, or subcontractors who need to know such information for the purpose of performing this Agreement and who are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those in this Section 8; and **(c)** use the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information solely for the purposes of exercising rights or performing obligations under this Agreement, and for no other purpose without the Disclosing Party’s prior written consent.

**8.2 Permitted Disclosures:** Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent required by law, regulation, or court order, provided that (to the extent legally permissible) the Receiving Party gives prompt written notice to the Disclosing Party of such requirement so that the Disclosing Party may seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy. If disclosure is ultimately required, the Receiving Party shall disclose only that portion of Confidential Information legally required and shall use reasonable efforts to ensure the information is treated confidentially by the receiving authority.

**8.3 Confidentiality of Agreement:** The terms and conditions of this Agreement (including pricing and the existence of the Agreement) are considered Confidential Information of both Parties and shall not be disclosed to any third party except: (i) to the Parties’ respective legal counsel, accountants, or advisors who are bound by confidentiality, (ii) as required by law or regulation (e.g., disclosures in financial statements or regulatory filings), or (iii) with the express written consent of the other Party. However, each Party may publicly refer to the other as a business partner or customer, consistent with Section 12 (Publicity), without disclosing specific terms.

**8.4 Return of Confidential Information:** Upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement, or upon written request of the Disclosing Party at any time, the Receiving Party shall promptly return to the Disclosing Party or destroy (at the Disclosing Party’s choice) all materials embodying the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information in the Receiving Party’s possession or control, and certify in writing that it has done so, except that the Receiving Party may retain one archival copy of Confidential Information solely for the purpose of monitoring its continuing obligations under this Agreement or as required by law. Any Confidential Information retained shall remain subject to the confidentiality obligations of this Agreement.

**8.5 Duration of Confidentiality Obligations:** The obligations in this Section 8 shall commence on the Effective Date and continue for a period of **five (5) years** after the termination or expiration of this Agreement, except with respect to trade secrets and Customer Data, for which the obligations of confidentiality shall survive indefinitely (or for as long as permitted by applicable law).

**8.6 Equitable Relief:** Each Party acknowledges that any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party, inadequately compensable by monetary damages. Therefore, in addition to any other legal remedies that may be available, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent or curtail any actual or threatened breach of this Section 8 by the Receiving Party.

## **9\. Security and Cybersecurity Obligations**

**9.1 Virus and Malware Protection:** Each Party shall take commercially reasonable precautions to prevent the introduction of any computer viruses, malware, worms, Trojan horses, or other malicious code (“**Malicious Code**”) into the System or the other Party’s systems. CICO, as the hosting provider, shall maintain continuous malware detection, vulnerability management, and antivirus protection across the entire hosted System environment. CICO shall ensure that the System—when accessed and used in accordance with the Documentation—is free from any known Malicious Code designed to disrupt operations, corrupt data, or permit unauthorized access. CICO shall routinely scan all hosted environments, data transfers, and any downloadable client components or exports for Malicious Code prior to release or deployment. If any Malicious Code is detected to have originated from the CICO-hosted environment, CICO shall promptly notify the Bank and take all necessary measures to identify, contain, and remove the Malicious Code, as well as mitigate any impact on the System or the Bank’s data. The Bank shall remain responsible for maintaining appropriate endpoint and network-level protections (such as antivirus, anti-malware, and intrusion detection) within its own internal systems and user devices that connect to the System.

**9.2 Security Measures by CICO:** CICO shall implement robust security measures in the design, development, and support of the System. Such measures include, but are not limited to: user authentication controls within the System, role-based access permissions, encryption of sensitive data fields as appropriate, secure coding practices to avoid common vulnerabilities (like SQL injection, XSS, etc.), and regular security testing of the System’s components. CICO shall promptly address any security vulnerability in the System that is reported by The Bank or identified by CICO’s own testing or threat intelligence, by providing a patch or workaround to The Bank through the support process.

**9.3 Security Measures by The Bank:** The Bank shall be responsible for maintaining the **security of its own IT environments, networks, and user devices** that connect to the CICO-hosted System. This includes maintaining up-to-date antivirus software, firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and endpoint protection to safeguard the Bank’s internal infrastructure and prevent unauthorized access to the System. The Bank shall properly configure and utilize all security features of the System—such as access controls, password and session policies, and audit logs—in accordance with the Documentation and CICO’s security guidance, to ensure that Customer Data and operational data are accessed only by authorized personnel. CICO shall remain responsible for applying all security patches, updates, and configuration changes to the hosted System and its underlying infrastructure. The Bank shall, however, cooperate with CICO in the timely implementation of any required security actions or user-side controls recommended by CICO (for example, enforcing multi-factor authentication, role-based access, or encryption practices). The Bank shall also comply with any additional cybersecurity standards or regulatory guidelines mutually established by the Parties or mandated by relevant authorities (including, without limitation, requirements on data encryption, user access control, and authentication for privileged users).

**9.4 Incident Management:** Each Party shall notify the other within 30 minutes of detection for P1 service-impacting incidents and within 24 hours for other security incidents that may adversely impact the System or the data processed therein. A security incident includes any actual or suspected unauthorized access to the System, any breach of the System’s security, or any incident of hacking or misuse that could compromise the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of the System or Customer Data. In the event of such an incident, the Parties will collaborate in good faith to investigate and mitigate the issue. CICO will take the lead in technical remediation if the incident directly concerns the System’s software, while The Bank will take the lead if the incident originates in The Bank’s environment (e.g., a compromised user account or device). Regardless of origin, each Party will provide reasonable cooperation to the other in investigating the incident, including sharing relevant log information and findings, consistent with the Parties’ security and confidentiality obligations.

**9.5 Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery:** CICO warrants that it maintains and shall continuously update a comprehensive Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BC/DR) Plan for all System operations hosted within the CICO Data Center. This plan includes, without limitation, scheduled data backups, replication to a secure secondary site within Ethiopia, procedures for restoring production services, and maintenance of the source code, configuration files, and support environments necessary to resume operations in the event of a disruption.

CICO shall ensure that:

* Regular backup and restoration tests are conducted in accordance with the defined Service Level Objectives;  
* A secondary disaster recovery environment is maintained and capable of assuming operations within the Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) specified in Annex G; and  
* Business continuity measures comply with applicable data-protection and banking-sector regulations in Ethiopia.

The Bank shall be responsible for maintaining its own business continuity and operational procedures covering user access, connectivity, and local data synchronization for its branches, terminals, and integration points. The Bank shall cooperate with CICO in testing or simulating disaster recovery drills and provide any necessary access or coordination required for such tests. CICO shall provide reasonable support to the Bank during such exercises, including participation in annual DR drills, validation of data integrity, and post-event reporting.

**9.6 Ongoing Compliance:** CICO shall keep itself informed of and in compliance with evolving cybersecurity laws and regulations that apply to the System or the services provided (such as any directives from financial regulators on ICT risk, if applicable in Ethiopia). The Bank likewise will ensure compliance with any specific cybersecurity mandates it is subject to (e.g., requirements from the National Bank for data protection or business continuity in financial services), and CICO will assist as needed to enable the System to meet those mandates (potentially as additional scope if significant changes are needed).

**9.7 Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Management:** CICO shall maintain a formal vulnerability management and penetration testing program as part of its overall security framework. This program shall include regular internal and external vulnerability scans, code security reviews, and periodic third-party penetration tests covering the System and its hosting environment. CICO shall perform vulnerability assessments and penetration tests at least annually, or more frequently where required by regulatory standards or material platform changes. Summary results or confirmation of completion (excluding sensitive details) shall be made available to the Bank upon written request for audit or compliance purposes. Identified vulnerabilities shall be prioritized, remediated, and tracked in accordance with industry best practices and the timelines defined in CICO’s internal vulnerability management policy, consistent with applicable banking and cybersecurity regulations.

## **10\. Warranties**

**10.1 Performance Warranty:** CICO warrants that the System, as **configured and used** in accordance with the Documentation, will perform in all material respects according to the specifications and functionalities described in the Documentation and this Agreement. During an initial warranty period of **twelve (12) months** from the Go Live Date (or, if earlier, fifteen (15) months from the Effective Date), CICO shall, at its own cost and as part of its warranty obligation, correct or repair any reproducible material defect in the System reported by The Bank in writing. CICO will use diligent efforts to correct such defect within a reasonable time frame, consistent with the severity of the issue (and in line with SLA timelines for critical issues). If CICO is unable to remedy a material defect or failure of the System to conform to the warranty after a reasonable number of attempts, The Bank’s sole remedy and CICO’s sole liability will be as set forth in Section 10.4 below.

**Clarification on Warranty vs. Monthly Fees:** The 12-month warranty period covers software defects and bugs only. It does not waive or defer the monthly AMS Fees payable under Section 3.1(a), which cover ongoing hosting, support, and managed operations services. Both the warranty and monthly AMS Fees are in effect simultaneously from the Go-Live Date.

**10.2 Support Warranty:** CICO warrants that all support, maintenance, and other professional services it provides under this Agreement will be performed with promptness and diligence and in a workmanlike and professional manner by qualified personnel, in accordance with the standards generally observed in the software services industry for similar services.

**10.3 Virus Warranty:** CICO warrants that it will not knowingly introduce any Malicious Code into The Bank’s systems via the System or any deliverables. In the event any virus, malware, or similar malicious element is found to have been introduced by CICO’s deliverables, CICO shall be responsible for, and will bear the cost of, cleaning the infected systems and restoring any damaged software or data from the last clean backups.

**10.4 Remedies and Disclaimer:** The warranties in this Section 10 are **exclusive** and in lieu of all other warranties, conditions or terms, express or implied, by statute or otherwise, including any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement, all of which are hereby disclaimed to the fullest extent permitted by law. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, the System and services are provided on an “as is” basis. **If the System fails to meet the foregoing performance warranty, The Bank’s exclusive remedy and CICO’s sole obligation shall be for CICO to use diligent efforts to repair or replace the non-conforming Software as described above.** If CICO is unable to restore the System’s functionality such that it materially conforms to the warranty within a reasonable time (not less than 30 days) from the date of written notice of breach of warranty, then The Bank may terminate this Agreement for material breach pursuant to Section 15.2 and, in such event, The Bank shall be entitled to a pro-rata refund of any prepaid fees covering the period of the breach (e.g., any prepaid monthly fees for time after termination).

The Bank acknowledges that software is inherently complex and may not be completely free of errors or bugs, and that not all errors will necessarily be corrected, provided that the System meets the material performance standards set forth in this Agreement.

**10.5 The Bank’s Warranties:** The Bank warrants that: (i) it has the right and authority to enter into and perform this Agreement, and doing so will not violate any other agreement or legal obligation by which The Bank is bound; (ii) it will use the System in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and only for lawful purposes; and (iii) any materials or data provided by The Bank to CICO (including Customer Data and logos or content for integration) shall not infringe any third-party rights or violate any laws.

## **11\. Limitation of Liability**

**11.1 Exclusion of Certain Damages:** **To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, neither Party shall be liable to the other Party for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages whatsoever,** or for any loss of profits, loss of revenue, loss of business opportunity, loss of data, or business interruption losses, arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the use or performance of the System or services, even if the Party has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if a remedy fails of its essential purpose.

**11.2 Cap on Liability:** Except for the specific liabilities excluded from limitation in Section 11.3 below, **each Party’s aggregate liability to the other for all claims, losses or damages arising under or related to this Agreement, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise, shall not exceed the total amount of fees paid or payable by The Bank to CICO under this Agreement in the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim.** If the event giving rise to the claim occurs before twelve months of fees have accrued, the liability cap shall be the average monthly fees paid up to that point multiplied by twelve (or, if the payment model has shifted to revenue share, the average monthly revenue share paid prior to the event multiplied by twelve).

**11.3 Exceptions:** **Nothing in this Agreement shall operate to exclude or limit**: (a) a Party’s liability for death or personal injury caused by its negligence or willful misconduct, or for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; (b) CICO’s obligations to indemnify for third-party intellectual property claims as provided in Section 6.3; (c) The Bank’s obligation to pay all fees properly due and owing under this Agreement; (d) either Party’s liability for its breach of Section 8 (Confidentiality) or The Bank’s liability for use of the System beyond the scope of the License; or (e) any liability which cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law; (f) a Party’s liability arising from a breach of Section 7 (Data Protection); (g) a Party’s willful misconduct or gross negligence. To the extent such liabilities are not permitted to be limited by law, they are not limited by the provisions of this Section 11\.

**11.4 Mitigation:** Each Party has a duty to mitigate any losses it may incur as a result of the other Party’s breach of this Agreement or in relation to any cause of action under or in connection with this Agreement.

**11.5 Application:** The limitations and exclusions of liability in this Section 11 shall apply regardless of the form of action, whether liability is based on contract, warranty, negligence, strict liability, tort, indemnity, or any other legal theory. These provisions reflect a deliberate allocation of risks between the Parties, and each Party acknowledges that the other Party would not enter into this Agreement without these limitations on its liability.

## **12\. Publicity**

Unless otherwise agreed, each Party **may refer to the existence of this commercial relationship in its marketing or public communications.** For example, during the term of this Agreement, both CICO and The Bank are permitted to include the other Party’s name and/or logo in lists of customers or partners on websites, presentations, or proposals, and to describe in general terms the nature of the collaboration (e.g., that The Bank is using CICO’s platform for its digital financial services).

However, neither Party shall disclose any Confidential Information or specific non-public details of the project in any public announcement or press release without the prior written consent of the other Party. Any formal press release or case study referencing the other Party will be subject to prior approval. The Bank agrees that CICO may list The Bank as a client for the System and use The Bank’s logo for such purpose, in accordance with any branding guidelines provided by The Bank.

## **13\. Breach and Remedies**

**13.1 Breach of Agreement:** Each of the following shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement, provided that the breaching Party fails to cure the breach within any applicable cure period specified:

* **(a) Unauthorized Use or Disclosure:** Any misuse of the System or Documentation by The Bank (including use beyond the License scope or breach of confidentiality obligations regarding CICO’s Confidential Information or IP) or any unauthorized disclosure by either Party of the other’s Confidential Information, which results in or could result in harm to the other Party.

* **(b) Failure to Perform Obligations:** Failure by either Party to perform any material obligation under this Agreement (including but not limited to The Bank’s failure to pay fees when due, or CICO’s failure to meet critical support obligations as defined in the SLA) within the time period specified by the Agreement. This includes, for example, CICO’s failure to deliver key deliverables within the agreed timeline without an approved schedule change, or The Bank’s failure to provide required resources or information causing significant project delay.

* **(c) Notice of Breach:** If a Party becomes aware of its own breach (for instance, an internal discovery of unauthorized use of data), and fails to promptly notify the other Party in writing of such breach and take reasonable steps to remedy it, such failure to notify can itself be considered a breach in bad faith.

* **(d) Insolvency or Ceasing Operation:** If either Party becomes insolvent, or has a receiver appointed, or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or is the subject of any proceeding related to liquidation or insolvency (voluntary or involuntary) which is not dismissed within a reasonable period, or ceases to carry on business in the ordinary course, such event shall be considered a breach. The affected Party shall inform the other as soon as reasonably practicable of such circumstances.

* **(e) Regulatory Non-Compliance:** If The Bank’s use of the System, or CICO’s provision of the System, is determined by a regulator or court of competent jurisdiction to be in material violation of law and one Party fails to take required corrective action within the timeline stipulated by the authorities or agreed between the Parties.

**13.2 Notice and Cure:** Except where specified otherwise, the non-breaching Party shall give the breaching Party written notice describing the nature of a material breach. The breaching Party shall have a period of **thirty (30) days** (or a shorter reasonable period if the breach is one that materially affects the other Party’s rights and needs urgent remedy, or as specified elsewhere in this Agreement) from receipt of notice to cure the breach to the reasonable satisfaction of the non-breaching Party. If the breaching Party fails to cure the breach within the cure period, the non-breaching Party may pursue the remedies set forth in Section 13.3 below.

**13.3 Remedies for Uncured Breach:**

* **(a) Termination for Cause:** The non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement (in whole or in part) pursuant to Section 15.2 if the breach is not cured within the applicable cure period. In the event of such termination for cause by The Bank due to CICO’s breach, CICO shall refund to The Bank any prepaid fees covering the period after the effective termination date. In the event of termination for cause by CICO due to The Bank’s breach, any fees prepaid by The Bank are non-refundable and any fees accrued or due up to the termination date shall become immediately due and payable.

* **(b) Suspension (for non-payment):** If The Bank is in material breach due to non-payment of fees and fails to cure within the cure period, CICO shall have the right, without terminating the Agreement, to suspend its performance of Support Services or access to the System (for example, by disabling login or updates) until The Bank has paid all outstanding undisputed amounts. CICO shall give at least fifteen (15) days’ advance written notice of any such suspension. Suspension of services shall not be CICO’s first recourse unless the payment default is significant or repeated.

* **(c) Legal and Equitable Relief:** The non-breaching Party may seek all other legal or equitable remedies available under law to address the breach, including specific performance, injunctions (especially for breaches of confidentiality or IP rights), and damages, subject to the limitations and exclusions set forth in this Agreement.

**13.4 Continuation of Obligations:** During the period of notice and cure for any alleged breach (and any dispute resolution period), the Parties shall continue to perform their obligations under this Agreement to the extent possible. For example, if The Bank alleges a material failure in the System, CICO should continue to provide support efforts to resolve it during the cure period; if CICO alleges non-payment, The Bank should pay any undisputed portions and work in good faith to resolve disputes.

**13.5 Cumulative Remedies:** Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, all rights and remedies under this Agreement are cumulative and in addition to any other rights or remedies available at law or in equity.

## **14\. Force Majeure**

**14.1 Non-Liability for Force Majeure:** Neither Party shall be liable for any failure or delay in performing its obligations under this Agreement (except for payment obligations) if and to the extent such failure or delay is due to **Force Majeure**. The affected obligations and timelines shall be extended for a period equaling the duration of the Force Majeure event, provided that the Party invoking Force Majeure complies with the obligations of this Section.

**14.2 Examples of Force Majeure:** Force Majeure events include, but are not limited to: natural disasters (such as floods, earthquakes, or epidemics/pandemics); war, invasion, acts of foreign enemies, hostilities, civil war, rebellion, or riots; government restrictions or actions (such as currency restrictions, embargoes, or trade sanctions); terrorist acts; strikes, labor disputes or lockouts (other than those involving only the invoking Party’s personnel); widespread utility or communication failures not caused by the obligated Party; or any other events beyond the reasonable control of the Party whose performance is affected.

**14.3 Notification and Mitigation:** A Party affected by a Force Majeure event (the “Affected Party”) shall: **(a)** promptly (and no later than seven (7) days after the onset of the event) notify the other Party in writing of the event, describing its nature and expected duration, and the particular obligations impacted; and **(b)** use all reasonable efforts to mitigate the effects of the Force Majeure event and resume full performance as soon as possible. The Affected Party shall keep the other Party reasonably informed of the progress in overcoming the Force Majeure event.

**14.4 Option to Terminate:** If any Force Majeure event persists for a continuous period of **three (3) months** or more such that it effectively frustrates the purpose of this Agreement or renders a material part of the Agreement unperformable, then either Party may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the other, without further liability (save for payment of any fees for services already rendered or System components already delivered up to the date of such termination). Upon such termination due to Force Majeure, any prepaid fees for services not rendered will be refunded to The Bank, and each Party will bear its own costs incurred due to the Force Majeure (unless otherwise agreed).

**14.5 No Excuse for Financial Hardship:** For the avoidance of doubt, economic hardship, changes in market conditions, or insufficient business performance shall not constitute Force Majeure events. Each Party assumes the risk of its own financial and business conditions in entering this Agreement.

## **15\. Term and Termination**

**15.1 Term of Agreement:** This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and, unless earlier terminated in accordance with its terms, shall remain in effect for an initial term of five (5) years from the Go Live Date (the “Initial Term”). Thereafter, the Agreement shall automatically renew for successive **one (1) year** terms (each a “Renewal Term”) unless either Party gives the other Party at least ninety (90) days’ written notice of non-renewal prior to the end of the then-current term. (If the Parties prefer a perpetual license with ongoing support, adjust this provision accordingly, or state that the license is perpetual but support is annual. Here, a fixed term is assumed for clarity.)

**15.2 Termination for Cause:** Either Party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to the other Party if the other Party commits a material breach of this Agreement and (in the case of a breach capable of cure) fails to cure that breach within the applicable cure period specified in Section 13.2. Material breaches include (without limitation) those listed in Section 13.1 (Breach) above. If The Bank terminates for cause due to CICO’s uncured breach, The Bank shall be entitled to a pro-rata refund of any prepaid monthly fees covering the period after termination, and any obligation of The Bank to pay further fixed fees or revenue share shall cease as of the termination date (except that The Bank must pay any accrued but unpaid fees or revenue share up to that date). If CICO terminates for cause due to The Bank’s breach, The Bank shall immediately pay all outstanding fees due and any fixed fees that would have been payable through the end of the then-current term as a reasonable estimate of damages (or if the payment model has shifted to revenue share, an amount equal to 40% of the projected Chargeable Transaction revenue for the remainder of the term, as reasonably estimated based on prior performance).

**15.3 Mutual Termination (Convenience):** At any time after the System has been in live operation for at least **24 months** after go-live date, the Parties may mutually agree in writing to terminate this Agreement. If the Parties so agree, they shall negotiate in good faith any termination conditions, such as the effective date and any wind-down responsibilities. Either Party may propose a mutual termination if, for instance, business circumstances change or the partnership is no longer viable, but neither Party can force termination for convenience without the other’s consent (except as provided in Section 15.4 for early project termination).

**15.4 Early Termination by The Bank (Pre-Go-Live):** In the event The Bank decides to terminate this Agreement **prior to the Go Live Date** (for reasons other than CICO’s breach or Force Majeure) or indefinitely suspend the implementation project for a period exceeding three (3) months, the following shall apply: The Bank shall pay to CICO, within thirty (30) days of such termination notice, an early termination fee equal to (i) all costs and fees for Implementation Services performed and expenses incurred by CICO up to the termination date (to the extent not already paid), **plus** (ii) a minimum commitment fee equal to one (1) month of the average applicable AMS Tier Fee (currently ETB 500,000 per month, totaling ETB 500,000), as a genuine pre-estimate of CICO’s investment and opportunity cost in allocating resources for the project. This early termination fee is agreed not as a penalty, but as a genuine pre-estimate of a portion of CICO’s investment and opportunity cost in allocating resources for the project. Upon such payment and termination, The Bank will have no further rights to use the System (and any installed copies shall be removed as per 15.6).

**15.5 Effects of Termination:** Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason:

* **(a) Cessation of Use:** Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, the License granted to the Bank shall immediately terminate, and the Bank shall cease all access to and use of the System. Since the System is hosted and operated by CICO, the Bank shall not be required to uninstall any software components but shall ensure that all user access credentials, integrations, and API connections to the System are revoked or deactivated. The Bank shall return or destroy (at CICO’s instruction) all copies of Documentation, training materials, or other CICO-provided proprietary information in its possession, except as permitted under subsection (d) below for limited post-termination data access. An authorized officer of the Bank shall certify in writing within thirty (30) days after termination that all such access credentials have been deactivated and that all Documentation and related materials have been returned or destroyed in compliance with CICO’s instructions.

* **(b) Payment of Amounts Due:** Each Party shall promptly pay any amounts that have accrued and are owed to the other Party as of the termination effective date. Invoices for any fees due as a result of termination (for example, early termination fees or outstanding revenue share) shall be submitted and paid within thirty (30) days. The Bank shall not be entitled to a refund of fees already paid except to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement.

* **(c) Return of Confidential Information:** Each Party shall return or destroy the other Party’s Confidential Information as set forth in Section 8.4. CICO will either return to The Bank or, at The Bank’s request, destroy all Customer Data in its possession, in accordance with Section 7.8 (Data Return/Deletion).

* **(d) Transition Assistance and Data Retrieval:** For a period of up to **three (3) months** following termination (or such other period as may be agreed in writing), CICO shall reasonably cooperate with The Bank, upon request, to facilitate the orderly transition of services or data. Specifically, if The Bank needs to retrieve historical data from the System post-termination, CICO may agree to provide The Bank with limited access to a non-production instance of the System or otherwise export data for The Bank. Such access shall be solely for data retrieval and reporting purposes and not for processing new transactions or serving new customers. During any agreed post-termination access period, The Bank remains bound by all relevant terms of this Agreement (e.g., confidentiality, no sublicense, etc.). CICO reserves the right to conduct audits during this period to ensure the System is not being used beyond the agreed scope (for example, to ensure The Bank is not conducting live transactions). Any material breach of this limited-use arrangement will entitle CICO to immediately terminate all access and seek remedies for unlicensed use.

* **(d-1) Data Portability:** Upon termination or at The Bank's request during the three-month transition period, CICO shall provide The Bank with a complete export of all Customer Data in industry-standard, machine-readable formats at no additional charge. The data export shall include, at minimum:
  - All user account data (usernames, profiles, KYC information, contact details)
  - Complete transaction history (all transactions with timestamps, amounts, fees, status)
  - Account balances and historical balance records
  - Operator/agent data and performance records
  - Configuration data (fee schedules, workflow rules, user permissions)
  - Audit logs and system activity logs (where technically feasible)
  
  **Export Formats:** Data shall be provided in one or more of the following formats, as technically appropriate for each data type: CSV (Comma-Separated Values), JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), or XML (Extensible Markup Language). Database schema documentation shall be provided to facilitate data import into alternative systems. CICO shall deliver the complete data export within **thirty (30) calendar days** of The Bank's written request. The data export is intended to enable The Bank to migrate to an alternative system or maintain records for regulatory compliance.

* **(e) System Deactivation:** CICO may take steps to remotely deactivate or secure the System to prevent further use by The Bank after termination, provided that CICO shall not interfere with The Bank’s ability to access its own data during any agreed transition period. The Bank expressly agrees to allow such deactivation actions and will not hinder CICO from ensuring the System is no longer used beyond the termination date, except as permitted under (d).

* **(f) Survival:** Any provision of this Agreement that by its nature or context is intended to survive termination (including, but not limited to, provisions on Intellectual Property Rights, confidentiality, data protection to the extent applicable post-termination, limitation of liability, dispute resolution, and any accrued payment obligations) shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.

**15.6 No Release:** Termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason shall not release either Party from any liability or obligation which, at the time of termination, has already accrued to the other Party or which is attributable to a period prior to termination, nor preclude either Party from pursuing any rights and remedies it may have under law (subject to the limitations in this Agreement) with respect to any breach of this Agreement.

## **16\. Change of Control or Legal Status**

**16.1 Notification of Change:** The Bank shall promptly notify CICO in writing in the event of any impending or actual change in The Bank’s legal status or structure that would affect this Agreement. This includes, but is not limited to: any merger or consolidation involving The Bank, any acquisition of The Bank by a third party, a significant change in ownership or control of The Bank (for example, sale of a majority of its equity or transfer of controlling interest), a change of The Bank’s name or corporate form, or any transfer of the banking license or business operations to another entity.

**16.2 Rights in Case of Change:** In the event of such change of control or legal entity of The Bank, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of The Bank’s successor or acquirer, **provided** that: (a) The Bank gives CICO at least thirty (30) days’ prior notice (or if not possible, as much notice as practicable) before the change is effected; (b) the successor or acquirer is not a direct competitor of CICO (if it is, CICO reserves the right to object reasonably to assignment, see Section 17); and (c) the successor/acquirer agrees in writing to assume all obligations of The Bank under this Agreement via a novation or assignment agreement reasonably acceptable to CICO. If any such change occurs without notice or CICO’s consent where required, CICO shall not be bound to honor this Agreement with the new entity until such requirements are fulfilled.

**16.3 No Automatic Termination:** A change in The Bank’s ownership or structure shall not automatically terminate this Agreement. The Bank (and its successors) remain liable for performance of this Agreement unless and until a formal assignment or novation is completed. The Bank may not use any change of control as a means to evade its responsibilities or liabilities under the Agreement.

**16.4 CICO’s Change of Control:** Similarly, CICO shall endeavor to notify The Bank of any material change in CICO’s corporate organization (such as a merger or acquisition by another company) that would reasonably impact the relationship or the fulfillment of this Agreement. In the event CICO is acquired by or merges with another company, this Agreement shall continue in effect with the successor entity obligated to perform as CICO, provided that CICO remains committed to supporting the System for The Bank. If CICO intends to transfer this Agreement as part of a sale of its business, it will seek The Bank’s consent as described in Section 17 (Assignment).

## **17\. Assignment and Successors**

**17.1 No Assignment Without Consent:** Neither Party may assign, transfer, or novate this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations hereunder to any third party (including by operation of law, or in connection with a merger or sale of business, except as provided in Section 16 for The Bank) without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Any attempted assignment in violation of this clause shall be null and void.

**17.2 Permitted Transfers:** Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may assign this Agreement in its entirety, without the other Party’s consent, to: (i) an Affiliate of that Party (meaning an entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the Party, provided the assigning Party remains liable for performance); or (ii) a successor entity resulting from a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of the assigning Party’s assets or business, **provided** that such successor is not a direct competitor of the non-assigning Party and agrees in writing to be bound by all terms of this Agreement. In the case of The Bank, a change of control as addressed in Section 16 is also subject to this Section; CICO’s consent will not be unreasonably withheld if the conditions in Section 16 are met.

**17.3 Binding on Successors:** Subject to the restrictions on assignment above, this Agreement shall be **binding upon and inure to the benefit of** the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Each Party is entering this Agreement for the benefit of itself and its successors in interest, and the rights and obligations herein will pass to any such successor or assign in accordance with this Section.

**17.4 Third-Party Access:** The Bank shall not permit any third party (other than The Bank’s authorized employees or contractors, or The Bank’s Affiliates performing internal business functions on behalf of The Bank) access or use the System (including admin portals and databases) without CICO’s prior written approval. If The Bank engages any third-party consultants or service providers who require access to the System (for example, a third-party IT maintenance contractor), The Bank must ensure such third party is under obligations of confidentiality and restricted use at least as protective as those herein, and The Bank will remain responsible for any breach of this Agreement caused by such third party. In any event, direct access to the System’s software code or database by third parties is prohibited unless explicitly agreed by CICO in writing (and potentially supervised by CICO).

## **18\. Waiver**

**18.1 No Implied Waivers:** **The failure or delay of either Party to enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision,** and it shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or default. Similarly, any single or partial exercise of a right or remedy by either Party does not preclude further exercise of that right or the exercise of any other right or remedy.

**18.2 Formal Waivers:** Any waiver of a provision of this Agreement by a Party must be in writing and signed by an authorized representative of that Party to be effective. Any such waiver shall be effective only for the specific instance and purpose stated. For example, if CICO agrees in writing to waive the enforcement of a deadline or a late payment for one occasion, that waiver does not obligate CICO to waive similar breaches in the future.

**18.3 Cumulative Rights:** The rights and remedies of the Parties under this Agreement are cumulative and may be exercised in any order. A waiver of any particular right or remedy shall not be deemed a waiver of any other right or remedy.

## **19\. Entire Agreement and Severability**

**19.1 Entire Agreement:** This Agreement, including its recitals and all Schedules, Annexes, and Attachments (all of which are hereby incorporated by reference), constitutes the **entire, complete agreement** between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes and replaces all prior or contemporaneous discussions, proposals, negotiations, understandings, or agreements (whether written or oral) relating to the same subject. Each Party acknowledges that in entering into this Agreement it has not relied on any statement, representation, warranty, or agreement not expressly set out in this Agreement.

**19.2 Amendments:** No amendment, modification, or supplement to this Agreement shall be valid unless it is **made in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both Parties**. This includes any change to the scope, fees, or terms; email correspondence or oral discussions shall not constitute an amendment unless documented and signed by both Parties as an addendum or amendment to this Agreement.

**19.3 Severability:** If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court or arbitral tribunal of competent jurisdiction, that provision shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable (if possible) or, if modification is not possible, it shall be severed from this Agreement. The remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall be construed so as to best effectuate the original intent of the Parties as expressed in this Agreement, minus the unenforceable provision.

**19.4 Precedence:** In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the terms of the main body of this Agreement and any Annex or Schedule, the following order of precedence shall apply:

2. The main body of this Agreement (Sections 1-21)
3. Annexes A-I (technical, operational, and commercial annexes)

For commercial terms (pricing, fees, service scope, and payment terms), Annex F (SaaS Tier Pricing), Annex I (Pass-Through Cost Structure), and Annex J (Full Pricing Schedule) shall prevail over any conflicting language in the main Agreement. For legal terms (warranties, liabilities, dispute resolution, confidentiality, IP rights), the main body of the Agreement shall prevail.

In case of conflict between this Agreement and any purchase order or other ordering document, the terms of this Agreement shall govern (unless such document is signed by both Parties and expressly amends specific provisions of this Agreement).

## **21\. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution**

**21.1 Governing Law:** This Agreement and any disputes arising out of or relating to it shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the **Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia**.

**21.2 Amicable Resolution:** In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination, or validity thereof, the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute amicably through negotiations between senior management of both Parties. Either Party may give the other written notice of a dispute (a “Dispute Notice”), after which the Parties shall promptly meet (in person or via teleconference) to discuss the dispute and seek an amicable resolution. If the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days of the Dispute Notice (or such longer period as they may mutually agree), then the dispute shall be referred to **arbitration** as set forth below.

**21.3 Arbitration:** **Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, including any question regarding its existence, interpretation, performance, breach, or termination, that cannot be resolved amicably as above, shall be finally settled by binding arbitration.** The arbitration shall be conducted in **Addis Ababa, Ethiopia** (the seat of arbitration) in accordance with the arbitration laws of Ethiopia and the following provisions:

* The arbitration panel shall consist of **three (3) arbitrators**. Each Party shall appoint one arbitrator within fifteen (15) days of a written request by either Party to commence arbitration. The two party-appointed arbitrators shall then jointly select the third arbitrator, who will act as the **presiding arbitrator (chair)** of the tribunal, within fifteen (15) days of the appointment of the second arbitrator. If either Party fails to appoint its arbitrator within the 15-day period, or if the two arbitrators fail to agree on the third arbitrator within the allotted time, the missing arbitrator(s) shall be appointed, upon request of either Party, by the appropriate appointing authority or institution in Ethiopia (for example, in accordance with the Arbitration and Conciliation Working Procedure Proclamation No. 1237/2021, or by the Arbitration Institute that the Parties have agreed to use, or by the court if applicable).

* The arbitrators shall be individuals with experience in software licensing or information technology disputes and shall be independent of the Parties.

* The language of the arbitration shall be **Amharic**, and all submissions and proceedings shall be conducted in Amharic, unless the Parties agree to use another language and the tribunal consents.

* The arbitral tribunal shall have the power to order any remedy or relief that a court of law could order under the Agreement, including specific performance, injunctive relief (interim or final), and damages (subject to the limitations of liability agreed herein). The tribunal shall also decide on the allocation of costs of the arbitration (including arbitrators’ fees and reasonable legal fees of the prevailing party) in its award.

* The arbitration award shall be final and binding on the Parties. Judgment on the award may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction for enforcement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties expressly reserve the right to appeal to a court of law on any arbitral award, in accordance with applicable law.

**21.4 Interim Measures:** Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent either Party from seeking interim or provisional measures (such as a preliminary injunction or other equitable relief) in a court of competent jurisdiction **before or during the arbitration** to preserve the status quo, prevent irreparable harm, or secure the enforcement of any arbitration award. Seeking such interim relief shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.

**21.5 Confidentiality of Proceedings:** The Parties shall keep the existence of the arbitration, all arbitration proceedings, and any arbitration award confidential, except to the extent necessary to enforce an award or as required by law or regulatory authorities.

**21.6 Continued Performance:** During the pendency of any dispute and arbitration proceedings, the Parties shall continue to perform their undisputed obligations under this Agreement (including The Bank’s obligation to pay any undisputed fees) to the extent practicable, and the existence of a dispute shall not by itself constitute a justification for a Party’s non-performance of any such obligations.

**21.7 Waiver of Court Jurisdiction:** Except for the limited court actions permitted in this Section (interim measures or enforcement of award), the Parties agree that **the arbitration procedure provided herein shall be the exclusive means for resolving any disputes** arising under or related to this Agreement. The Parties irrevocably waive any right to a trial in national courts (whether by judge or jury) for such disputes, subject to the arbitration process.

**IN WITNESS WHEREOF**, the Parties have caused this Agreement to be executed by their duly authorized representatives as of the Effective Date first written above.

## **Pass-Through Costs (Deducted Before Revenue Split)**

The following third-party costs are **pass-through expenses** and are deducted from Gross Transaction Fees before calculating the revenue share:

* **National/Payment Switch Fees:** Charges from EthSwitch, NBE payment switch, or other national payment infrastructure providers for transaction routing and clearing.

* **Gateway MDR/Scheme Fees:** Merchant Discount Rates, interchange fees, and assessment fees charged by payment card schemes (Visa, Mastercard, etc.) or payment gateway providers.

* **Dispute and Chargeback Fees:** Fees incurred for handling transaction disputes, chargebacks, or fraud investigations by payment networks or third-party processors.

* **Media Buying for Marketing:** Direct media spend for Bank-approved marketing campaigns, including digital advertising, radio/TV spots, print media, and outdoor advertising. Campaign categories and approval processes are defined in Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2. (Note: Marketing operations and campaign management are included in the AMS Fee per Section 3.2; only actual media spend is pass-through).

## **NOT Pass-Through (Included in Managed Fee)**

The following costs are **covered by the Monthly AMS Fees** and are NOT deducted as pass-through:

* Core hosting infrastructure and data center operations
* Application maintenance, development, and platform upgrades
* Managed operations staff (support, customer ops, marketing ops, agent training)
* Security monitoring, backups, and disaster recovery
* Internal CICO operational costs

## **Verification and Audit**

Per Section 3.5, The Bank has the right, not more than once per calendar year, to audit pass-through cost calculations and request supporting documentation from CICO to verify that costs are:
* Actually incurred and paid
* Reasonable and at prevailing market rates
* Not marked up by CICO
* Properly allocated to The Bank's transactions

## **Media Spend Budget Framework and Campaign Execution Authority**

To provide budget predictability and operational efficiency for both Parties, the following framework applies to media spend for marketing campaigns:

(a) **Annual Marketing Budget:** The Parties shall agree on an indicative annual media spend budget at the start of each calendar year or contract year. This budget serves as a guideline and may be adjusted quarterly based on business performance.

(b) **Quarterly Allocation:** Media spend shall be allocated across quarters based on the approved Quarterly Marketing Plans (per Section 3.2.2). Typical allocation might be:
  - Q1 (Launch/GTM focus): 35-40% of annual budget
  - Q2-Q4 (Operational campaigns): 20-25% per quarter

(c) **Spending Authority:** Once a Quarterly Marketing Plan is approved by The Bank (or deemed approved per Section 3.2.2(c)), CICO has authority to execute media buying and operational campaigns up to the approved budget without requiring transaction-by-transaction approval from The Bank. This includes:
  - Negotiating with media vendors
  - Executing media buys within approved channels and budgets
  - Making tactical adjustments to optimize campaign performance
  - Shifting budget between media channels (e.g., from radio to digital) if total quarterly budget is maintained

(d) **Operational Campaign Threshold:** As specified in Section 3.2.1(b), operational campaigns with total cost (including media spend) under 30% of that month's Monthly Managed Fee may be executed by CICO with written notification to The Bank but without requiring prior approval, provided they align with approved quarterly themes and total annual budget.

(e) **Budget Overruns:** If actual media costs are projected to exceed the approved quarterly budget by more than ten percent (10%), CICO shall notify The Bank and obtain approval before incurring additional spend. Emergency or time-sensitive campaigns (e.g., competitive response, crisis management) may proceed with email notification if Bank approval cannot be obtained within twenty-four (24) hours.

(f) **Cost Verification:** All media spend invoices from third-party vendors shall be provided to The Bank monthly for verification as pass-through costs per Section 3.5. CICO shall maintain detailed records including vendor invoices, insertion orders, and proof of performance/delivery.

(g) **Vendor Selection:** CICO shall select media vendors and negotiate rates in accordance with industry best practices. The Bank may request vendor documentation during annual audits to verify that costs are reasonable and at prevailing market rates per the Verification and Audit provisions above.

## **7) Payment Terms for Change Requests**

* **Time & Materials:** Invoiced upon completion at ETB 5,000 per man-day (actual days worked)
* **Fixed Price:** 50% upfront upon approval, 50% upon UAT acceptance
* Payments due within Net 30 days of invoice date

## **8) Change Request Priority Levels**

| Priority | Response Time (Impact Assessment) | Typical Delivery Timeline |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Critical** (system issue or compliance requirement) | 2 business days | 2-4 weeks |
| **High** (significant business impact) | 5 business days | 4-8 weeks |
| **Medium** (moderate business value) | 7 business days | 8-12 weeks |
| **Low** (nice to have, low impact) | 10 business days | 12+ weeks or next major release |

Delivery timelines are estimates and subject to resource availability, complexity, and dependencies.

# **Annex L – Performance Benchmarks**

This Annex defines target performance benchmarks for the System. These benchmarks represent best-effort performance targets under normal operating conditions and are provided for planning and expectation-setting purposes.

## **Performance Benchmark Targets**

| Performance Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **API Response Time** | < 500ms (95th percentile) | Server-side measurement of API endpoint response times |
| **Transaction Processing Time** | < 2 seconds (end-to-end) | Time from transaction initiation to confirmation |
| **Page Load Time (Web Portal)** | < 3 seconds | Full page load including all assets |
| **Mobile App Response** | < 1.5 seconds | Screen transitions and data loading |
| **Report Generation** | < 30 seconds | Standard reports (transactions, balances, etc.) |
| **Concurrent Users** | 10,000 simultaneous users | System capacity without performance degradation |
| **Transaction Throughput** | 100 transactions per second | Peak transaction processing capacity |
| **Database Query Time** | < 200ms (average) | Standard operational queries |
| **Search Functionality** | < 1 second | User/transaction search results |
| **Batch Processing** | Per agreed schedule | Overnight batch jobs, reconciliation |

## **Important Notes**

**1. Best-Effort Targets:**  
These performance benchmarks are **best-effort targets**, not guaranteed service levels. Failure to meet these benchmarks does not constitute a breach of this Agreement unless System performance becomes so degraded that it renders the System unusable for normal business operations (which would be addressed under the uptime commitment and support SLA).

**2. Normal Operating Conditions:**  
Benchmarks assume normal operating conditions, including:
- Reasonable data volumes consistent with the licensed capacity
- Proper network connectivity from The Bank's side
- Standard transaction patterns and workflows
- No unusual spikes or abnormal usage patterns
- System operating within designed parameters

**3. Performance Degradation:**  
If The Bank experiences consistent performance issues that significantly impact business operations, The Bank should:
- Report the issue via the support channels (Section 4, Annex H)
- Provide specific examples and performance measurements
- Allow CICO to investigate and diagnose root causes
- Cooperate with CICO to implement performance improvements

**4. Optimization Responsibility:**  
CICO shall be responsible for:
- Maintaining appropriate infrastructure capacity
- Optimizing database queries and application code
- Monitoring system performance proactively
- Addressing performance bottlenecks as part of standard maintenance

**5. Factors Outside CICO Control:**  
Performance may be affected by factors outside CICO's control, including:
- The Bank's network bandwidth or latency
- Third-party service providers (payment switches, SMS gateways)
- Client device performance (older devices, slow browsers)
- Data volumes significantly exceeding projections
- DDoS attacks or external security threats

**6. Performance Monitoring:**  
CICO shall provide The Bank with access to performance dashboards and monitoring data through the System's administrative portal, including:
- Real-time system health indicators
- API response time metrics
- Transaction processing volumes and speeds
- System resource utilization
- Historical performance trends

**7. Capacity Planning:**  
CICO and The Bank shall conduct quarterly capacity planning reviews to:
- Assess current performance against benchmarks
- Project future growth and capacity needs
- Plan infrastructure upgrades if necessary
- Adjust benchmarks if usage patterns change significantly

**8. Escalation for Persistent Issues:**  
If performance consistently falls below these benchmarks and impacts The Bank's business operations:
- The Bank shall escalate via the support process (Annex H)
- CICO shall investigate and provide a remediation plan within 10 business days
- Parties shall work collaboratively to identify and resolve root causes
- If unresolved, the matter may be escalated to executive management

**9. No Service Credits:**  
Unless performance degradation results in violation of the uptime commitment (99.5% monthly availability), performance falling below these benchmarks does not trigger service credits. These are guidance targets, not contractual SLA commitments with financial penalties.

**10. Benchmark Updates:**  
These benchmarks may be updated annually during the contract review process to reflect:
- System improvements and upgrades
- Changes in typical usage patterns
- Industry standard evolution
- Technology improvements
