### **1\. Purpose and Scope**

1.1. The purpose of this Agreement is to establish the framework for collaboration between the Parties in identifying, preparing, submitting, and executing projects under RFQs, RFPs, or TORs issued by third parties. This Agreement governs how the Parties will cooperate in project implementation, resource allocation, financial arrangements, and benefit-sharing.  

1.2. The Agreement covers:

1.2.1. Joint proposal preparation and submission;  
1.2.2. Project implementation, monitoring, and evaluation;  
1.2.3. Profit and cost sharing;  
1.2.4. Governance, decision-making, and reporting;

2.2.5. Deliver financial oversight of funds flowing through the banking system.

### **3\. Financial Arrangements**

   
3.1.  **Project Budgets**

3.1.1. Each project shall include an **Annexed Budget** agreed upon prior to submission.  
3.1.2. Budgets shall distinguish **Implementation Costs**, **Operational Costs**, and **Contingency Reserves**.  
3.1.3. Shared costs (e.g., proposal preparation, consortium branding) shall be borne equally unless otherwise agreed. All payments made by either Party must be accompanied by official receipts or tax invoices as required by Ethiopian law.

3.2.  **Profit Sharing During Implementation**

3.2.1. Net profits from each project **during the implementation phase** shall be shared **50% to CICO and 50% to Hijra Bank**.  

3.2.2. "Net profits" = Gross revenues received during implementation – Direct implementation costs – Operator/field incentives – Regulatory fees.  

3.2.3. If a project mandates third-party sub-contractors, such expenses shall be deducted prior to profit calculation.

3.2.4. For clarity, this Section 3.2 applies only to revenues and costs incurred during the project implementation period. Post-implementation commercialization revenues are governed by Section 3.4.

3.3. **Fund Flow and Management**

3.3.1. **Fund Flow Process:** Project revenues shall be received directly by Hijra Bank's financial settlement account. CICO shall request implementation funds by submitting budget requests to Hijra Bank's Finance and Treasury Department, which shall approve and transfer the requested funds to CICO's project operating account within 5 business days. Once funds are transferred to CICO's operating account, CICO has full authority to spend such funds for project implementation purposes without requiring additional approvals from the Bank, as the Bank's authorization is deemed granted at the time of the initial fund transfer.

3.3.2. Hijra Bank shall manage **financial settlement accounts** for project revenues and shall be responsible for transferring approved implementation funds to CICO as set forth in Section 3.3.1.

3.3.3. Both Parties shall have audit rights and equal visibility into all accounts. CICO shall provide regular reporting on the use of implementation funds to ensure transparency and accountability.

3.4. **Post-Implementation Commercialization**

3.4.1. The Parties acknowledge that consortium projects under this Agreement utilize pre-existing Background IP (primarily Hijra Bank's HalalPay digital wallet platform combined with CICO's CICO CASH digital wallet platform, CICO's Soukify and other technical platforms, plus the Bank's banking infrastructure and regulatory framework) which are scaled, expanded, or customized for specific project requirements, rather than developing new standalone intellectual property.

3.4.2. **No Post-Project Revenue Sharing:** Given that no new intellectual property is created through consortium projects, there shall be no post-implementation commercialization revenue sharing arrangements between the Parties after project completion. All revenue sharing is limited to the project implementation period as defined in Section 3.2.

3.4.3. **Post-Project Use of Pre-Existing IP:** After project completion, if Hijra Bank or any project beneficiary wishes to continue using CICO's Background IP (platforms, systems, or services), such continued use shall be subject to separate commercial agreements between the Parties, negotiated in good faith and on commercially reasonable terms prevailing at the time.

3.4.4. **Project-Specific Arrangements:** Notwithstanding the above, the Parties may agree to different post-implementation arrangements for specific projects through project-specific annexes, provided such arrangements are documented in writing and signed by both Parties prior to project commencement.

### **4\. Audit and Transparency**

   
4.1. **Independent External Audits:** Either Party shall have the right, upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice and not more than once per calendar year, to appoint an independent external auditor to inspect the books and records related to any project under this Agreement.   
4.2. **Financial Reporting and Internal Audits:** Quarterly financial reports shall be circulated to both Parties. In addition, each Party's internal audit or finance department may conduct internal audit reviews up to one time per year, which are separate from and in addition to the independent external audits referenced in Section 4.1. For clarity, Hijra Bank may conduct one (1) internal audit per year of project finances and implementation expenditures, and CICO may conduct one (1) internal audit per year of project revenue collection and fund management.  
4.3. The costs of such audit shall be borne by the auditing Party, unless the audit reveals a material variance of more than five percent (5%) to its detriment, in which case the costs shall be shared by the other Party. 

### **5\. Governance and Decision-Making**

   
**5.1. Consortium Steering Committee**  
   
5.1.1. A Steering Committee shall be formed with equal representation from both Parties.  

5.1.2. **Regulatory Authority and Operational Decisions:**

(a) **Bank's Regulatory Authority:** The Bank's representative in the Steering Committee shall have unilateral and final decision-making authority on any matter where the Bank reasonably determines, in good faith, that action is necessary to ensure compliance with:
   - National Bank of Ethiopia regulations, directives, or supervisory guidance;
   - Banking license requirements or conditions;
   - Capital adequacy, liquidity, or prudential requirements;
   - Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) obligations;
   - Consumer protection regulations applicable to financial institutions;
   - Any other regulatory requirement that could impact the Bank's license, regulatory standing, or result in sanctions, penalties, or reputational harm to the Bank.

This regulatory authority is absolute and may be exercised even if it impacts CICO's operational decisions, project timelines, vendor selection, pricing, or technical implementation.

(b) **Documentation of Regulatory Nexus:** When exercising regulatory authority under Section 5.1.2(a), the Bank shall provide written notice to CICO that:
   - Identifies the specific regulatory requirement, directive, or risk that necessitates the decision;
   - Explains, in reasonable detail, how the matter at issue creates regulatory exposure for the Bank;
   - Describes the decision or action required to address the regulatory concern;
   - Includes reference to applicable laws, regulations, NBE directives, or regulatory guidance where available.

(c) **CICO's Operational Authority:** For matters that do not involve regulatory compliance as documented under Section 5.1.2(b), CICO's representative shall have final decision-making authority on:
   - Technical implementation approaches, methodologies, and architecture;
   - Vendor selection, procurement, and third-party service providers (subject to Bank's regulatory vetting rights);
   - Platform deployment schedules, testing protocols, and go-live decisions;
   - Project staffing, resource allocation, and team management;
   - Pricing strategies for consortium services and deliverables;
   - Day-to-day project execution and operational matters.

CICO's operational decisions shall be made in writing with justifiable business or technical reasons.

(d) **Good Faith and Regulatory Integrity:** Both Parties acknowledge that:
   - The Bank's regulatory authority under Section 5.1.2(a) exists to protect the Bank's license and regulatory standing, and shall be exercised in good faith only when genuine regulatory concerns exist;
   - CICO's operational authority under Section 5.1.2(c) exists to enable effective project management and technical execution, and shall be exercised in good faith to deliver quality outcomes;
   - Neither Party shall abuse its respective authority to obstruct the other Party's legitimate functions or to circumvent the governance framework of this Agreement.

(e) **Escalation for Disputed Regulatory Determinations:** If CICO believes, in good faith, that the Bank has invoked regulatory authority for a matter that does not genuinely present regulatory risk (i.e., as a pretext to interfere with operational decisions), CICO may escalate the matter to the CEOs per Section 5.1.3. However, this escalation right does not suspend or override the Bank's decision during the escalation period if the Bank determines that immediate action is necessary to prevent imminent regulatory harm. The escalation serves to: (i) create a record of the dispute, and (ii) allow the CEOs to establish clearer boundaries for future application of regulatory authority.   
5.1.3. All material decisions concerning the consortium and individual projects shall be made by the Steering Committee. The Steering Committee shall strive to make decisions by consensus. If consensus cannot be reached after good faith discussions, the matter shall be referred to the Chief Executive Officer / Vice President of CICO and the Chief Executive Officer / Vice President of Hijra Bank for resolution. If both CEOs cannot reach consensus within fifteen (15) business days, the matter shall either (i) be resolved through the dispute resolution mechanism in Section 11, or (ii) the specific project or decision in question shall not proceed without mutual written agreement.   
5.1.4. Functions of the committee: Approve proposals, budgets, project plans, and major decisions.   
   
**5.2. Project Management**  
   
5.2.1. CICO will appoint a **Project Director** responsible for daily operations.  

5.2.2. Hijra Bank will appoint a **Bank Liaison Officer** responsible for regulatory and institutional matters.  

5.2.3. The Bank shall participate in all discussions and decisions. For matters related to the Bank's regulatory compliance and financial standing as specified in Section 5.1.2, the final decision authority rests with the Bank's Chief Executive Officer / Vice President based on the mandates provided to them.

5.2.4. Similarly, CICO shall participate in all discussions and decisions. For matters related to project operations, technical implementation, platform deployment, vendor selection, staffing decisions, and day-to-day execution as the lead implementer (as specified in Section 5.1.2(c)), the final decision authority rests with CICO's Chief Executive Officer / Vice President, provided that such decisions are made in writing and with justifiable business or technical reasons. This authority ensures CICO can effectively manage operations, maintain implementation quality, and fulfill its responsibilities as consortium manager. This operational authority is subject to the Bank's overriding regulatory authority as set forth in Section 5.1.2(a) when genuine regulatory concerns exist.

### **6\. Project Lifecycle and Deliverables**

This joint ownership is subject to the profit-sharing provisions of Section 3.2 during the implementation phase only (with no post-project revenue sharing as set forth in Section 3.4.2)

(c) Non-transferable without the mutual written consent of both Parties

7.7.4. **Intellectual Property Enhancements:** Any improvements, enhancements, or modifications made to either Party's Background IP during the course of consortium projects shall remain the exclusive property of the respective Party that owns the underlying Background IP. Such enhancements may be used within the consortium projects subject to the revenue-sharing arrangements in Section 3.2 during the implementation phase (with no ongoing post-project revenue obligations as clarified in Section 3.4.2).

### **8\. Confidentiality**
