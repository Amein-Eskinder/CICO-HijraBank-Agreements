1.2.3. Profit and cost sharing;  
1.2.4. Governance, decision-making, and reporting;

2.1.2. Serve as the **primary liaison** with funding agencies, clients, and regulators.  
2.1.3. Provide digital platforms, project management expertise, and technical capacity for project implementation.

2.2.5. Deliver financial oversight of funds flowing through the banking system.

### **3\. Financial Arrangements**

   
3.1.  **Project Budgets**

3.1.1. Each project shall include an **Annexed Budget** agreed upon prior to submission.  
3.1.2. Budgets shall distinguish **Implementation Costs**, **Operational Costs**, and **Contingency Reserves**.  
3.1.3. Shared costs (e.g., proposal preparation, consortium branding) shall be borne equally unless otherwise agreed. All payments made by either Party must be accompanied by official receipts or tax invoices as required by Ethiopian law.

3.2.  **Profit Sharing During Implementation**

3.2.1. Net profits from each project **during the implementation phase** shall be shared **50% to CICO and 50% to Hijra Bank**.  

3.2.2. "Net profits" = Gross revenues received during implementation – Direct implementation costs – Operator/field incentives – Regulatory fees.  

3.2.3. If a project mandates third-party sub-contractors, such expenses shall be deducted prior to profit calculation.

3.2.4. For clarity, this Section 3.2 applies only to revenues and costs incurred during the project implementation period. Post-implementation commercialization revenues are governed by Section 3.4.

3.3. **Fund Flow and Management**

3.3.1. **Fund Flow Process:** Project revenues shall be received directly by Hijra Bank's financial settlement account. CICO shall request implementation funds by submitting budget requests to Hijra Bank's Finance and Treasury Department, which shall approve and transfer the requested funds to CICO's project operating account within 5 business days. Once funds are transferred to CICO's operating account, CICO has full authority to spend such funds for project implementation purposes without requiring additional approvals from the Bank, as the Bank's authorization is deemed granted at the time of the initial fund transfer.

3.3.2. Hijra Bank shall manage **financial settlement accounts** for project revenues and shall be responsible for transferring approved implementation funds to CICO as set forth in Section 3.3.1.

3.3.3. Both Parties shall have audit rights and equal visibility into all accounts. CICO shall provide regular reporting on the use of implementation funds to ensure transparency and accountability.

3.4. **Post-Implementation Commercialization**

3.4.1. The Parties acknowledge that consortium projects under this Agreement utilize pre-existing Background IP (primarily Hijra Bank's HalalPay digital wallet platform combined with CICO's CICO CASH digital wallet platform, CICO's Soukify and other technical platforms, plus the Bank's banking infrastructure and regulatory framework) which are scaled, expanded, or customized for specific project requirements, rather than developing new standalone intellectual property.

3.4.2. **No Post-Project Revenue Sharing:** Given that no new intellectual property is created through consortium projects, there shall be no post-implementation commercialization revenue sharing arrangements between the Parties after project completion. All revenue sharing is limited to the project implementation period as defined in Section 3.2.

3.4.3. **Post-Project Use of Pre-Existing IP:** After project completion, if Hijra Bank or any project beneficiary wishes to continue using CICO's Background IP (platforms, systems, or services), such continued use shall be subject to separate commercial agreements between the Parties, negotiated in good faith and on commercially reasonable terms prevailing at the time.

3.4.4. **Project-Specific Arrangements:** Notwithstanding the above, the Parties may agree to different post-implementation arrangements for specific projects through project-specific annexes, provided such arrangements are documented in writing and signed by both Parties prior to project commencement.

### **4\. Audit and Transparency**

   
4.1. **Independent External Audits:** Either Party shall have the right, upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice and not more than once per calendar year, to appoint an independent external auditor to inspect the books and records related to any project under this Agreement.   
4.2. **Financial Reporting and Internal Audits:** Quarterly financial reports shall be circulated to both Parties. In addition, each Party's internal audit or finance department may conduct internal audit reviews up to one time per year, which are separate from and in addition to the independent external audits referenced in Section 4.1. For clarity, Hijra Bank may conduct one (1) internal audit per year of project finances and implementation expenditures, and CICO may conduct one (1) internal audit per year of project revenue collection and fund management.  
4.3. The costs of such audit shall be borne by the auditing Party, unless the audit reveals a material variance of more than five percent (5%) to its detriment, in which case the costs shall be shared by the other Party. 

### **5\. Governance and Decision-Making**

   
**5.1. Consortium Steering Committee**  
   
5.1.1. A Steering Committee shall be formed with equal representation from both Parties.  

5.1.2. The Bank's representative in the Steering Committee shall have the authority to make final decisions on matters that are strictly and directly related to the Bank's regulatory license requirements under National Bank of Ethiopia regulations, capital adequacy requirements, or Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) obligations, provided that such decisions are made in writing and with justifiable reasons citing the specific regulatory requirement. For clarity, regulatory compliance shall not be invoked to override CICO's operational decisions on technical implementation, vendor selection, pricing, platform deployment, or project execution matters. Similarly, CICO's representative in the Steering Committee shall have the authority to make final decisions on matters that are strictly related to project operations, technical implementation, platform deployment, vendor selection, staffing decisions, and day-to-day execution, provided that such decisions are made in writing and with justifiable reasons.   
5.1.3. All material decisions concerning the consortium and individual projects shall be made by the Steering Committee. The Steering Committee shall strive to make decisions by consensus. If consensus cannot be reached after good faith discussions, the matter shall be referred to the Chief Executive Officer / Vice President of CICO and the Chief Executive Officer / Vice President of Hijra Bank for resolution. If both CEOs cannot reach consensus within fifteen (15) business days, the matter shall either (i) be resolved through the dispute resolution mechanism in Section 11, or (ii) the specific project or decision in question shall not proceed without mutual written agreement.   
5.1.4. Functions of the committee: Approve proposals, budgets, project plans, and major decisions.   
   
**5.2. Project Management**  
   
5.2.1. CICO will appoint a **Project Director** responsible for daily operations.  

5.2.2. Hijra Bank will appoint a **Bank Liaison Officer** responsible for regulatory and institutional matters.  

5.2.3. The Bank shall participate in all discussions and decisions. For matters related to the Bank's regulatory compliance and financial standing as specified in Section 5.1.2, the final decision authority rests with the Bank's Chief Executive Officer / Vice President based on the mandates provided to them.

5.2.4. Similarly, CICO shall participate in all discussions and decisions. For matters related to project operations, technical implementation, platform deployment, vendor selection, staffing decisions, and day-to-day execution as the lead implementer, the final decision authority rests with CICO's Chief Executive Officer / Vice President, provided that such decisions are made in writing and with justifiable reasons. This authority ensures CICO can effectively manage operations, maintain implementation quality, and fulfill its responsibilities as consortium manager.
